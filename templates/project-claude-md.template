<!--
Orchestrator mode is active via superpowers plugin.
You do not need to add orchestration instructions here - they are loaded automatically via SessionStart hook.

The orchestrator will:
1. Check agent registry for matching specialist
2. Delegate complex tasks to specialists
3. Handle simple coordination directly
4. Manage multi-skill workflows
