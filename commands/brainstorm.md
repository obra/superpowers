Invoke the hyperpowers brainstorming skill and follow it EXACTLY as presented to you. This skill is available in the skills folder within the hyperpowers claude plugin. ONLY search there, do NOT look for brainstorming skills in the repo you are working in, or in other plugins. Do not assume you know how to brainstorm without finding the SKILL.md file.
