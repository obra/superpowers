# Superpowers

AI agents skip steps under time pressure. They bypass best practices when confident. They lack consistency across tasks. The result: bugs you didn't catch, designs you didn't validate, tests you didn't write.

**Superpowers fixes this.** Skills are mandatory instruction documents agents must follow. When a relevant skill exists, the agent checks for it, uses it, or fails the task.

## How It Works

At session start, the agent learns which skills exist. Before any task, the agent checks: "Does a skill match this work?" If yes, the agent loads and follows that skill.

Skills are markdown files with proven workflows. The `test-driven-development` skill forces RED-GREEN-REFACTOR. No test-first? Delete the code and start over. The skill prevents rationalization.

## The Workflow

**When you ask to build a feature:**

1. **brainstorming** - Activates before writing code. Refines rough ideas through questions, explores alternatives, presents design in sections for validation. Saves design document.

2. **using-git-worktrees** - Activates after design approval. Creates isolated workspace on new branch, runs project setup, verifies clean test baseline.

3. **writing-plans** - Activates with approved design. Breaks work into bite-sized tasks (2-5 minutes each). Every task has exact file paths, complete code, verification steps.

4. **subagent-driven-development** or **executing-plans** - Activates with plan. Dispatches fresh subagent per task (same session, fast iteration) or executes in batches (parallel session, human checkpoints).

5. **test-driven-development** - Activates during implementation. Enforces RED-GREEN-REFACTOR: write failing test, watch it fail, write minimal code, watch it pass, commit. Deletes code written before tests.

6. **requesting-code-review** - Activates between tasks. Reviews against plan, reports issues by severity. Critical issues block progress.

7. **finishing-a-development-branch** - Activates when tasks complete. Verifies tests, presents options (merge/PR/keep/discard), cleans up worktree.

**The agent checks for relevant skills before any task.** Mandatory workflows, not suggestions.

## Installation

**Note:** Installation differs by platform. Claude Code has a built-in plugin system. Codex and OpenCode require manual setup.

### Claude Code (via Plugin Marketplace)

In Claude Code, register the marketplace first:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
```

Then install the plugin from this marketplace:

```bash
/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
```

### Verify Installation

Check that commands appear:

```bash
/help
```

```
# Should see:
# /superpowers:brainstorm - Interactive design refinement
# /superpowers:write-plan - Create implementation plan
# /superpowers:execute-plan - Execute plan in batches
```

### Codex

Tell Codex:

```
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/superpowers/refs/heads/main/.codex/INSTALL.md
```

**Detailed docs:** [docs/README.codex.md](docs/README.codex.md)

### OpenCode

Tell OpenCode:

```
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/superpowers/refs/heads/main/.opencode/INSTALL.md
```

**Detailed docs:** [docs/README.opencode.md](docs/README.opencode.md)
