# Superpowers

Superpowers is a software development workflow for coding agents, built on a set of composable skills and startup instructions that help the agent choose the right level of process for the task.

## How it works

By default, Superpowers now starts in a lightweight `router-first` mode. Instead of forcing every task through the full planning stack, the agent classifies the work and chooses the lightest safe path:

- `small` -> inspect quickly, act directly, verify before claiming success
- `medium` -> share a short execution plan, then execute
- `large` -> explain the risk and ask whether to switch into the full heavy workflow

The original full Superpowers flow is still here when you want it: collaborative design, written specs, implementation plans, and subagent-driven execution. It just is no longer the default for every task.

That gives you both modes:

- `router-first` for fast, low-friction execution
- `using-superpowers` for the complete heavy workflow


## Sponsorship

If Superpowers has helped you do stuff that makes money and you are so inclined, I'd greatly appreciate it if you'd consider [sponsoring my opensource work](https://github.com/sponsors/obra).

Thanks!

## Installation

**Note:** Installation differs by platform. Claude Code or Cursor have built-in plugin marketplaces. Codex and OpenCode require manual setup.

### Claude Code Official Marketplace

Superpowers is available via the [official Claude plugin marketplace](https://claude.com/plugins/superpowers)

Install the plugin from Claude marketplace:

```bash
/plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official
```

### Claude Code (via Plugin Marketplace)

In Claude Code, register the marketplace first:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
```

Then install the plugin from this marketplace:

```bash
/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
```

### Cursor (via Plugin Marketplace)

In Cursor Agent chat, install from marketplace:

```text
/add-plugin superpowers
```

or search for "superpowers" in the plugin marketplace.

### Codex

Tell Codex:

```
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/superpowers/refs/heads/main/.codex/INSTALL.md
```

**Detailed docs:** [docs/README.codex.md](docs/README.codex.md)

### OpenCode

Tell OpenCode:

```
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/superpowers/refs/heads/main/.opencode/INSTALL.md
```

**Detailed docs:** [docs/README.opencode.md](docs/README.opencode.md)

### Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/obra/superpowers
```

To update:

```bash
gemini extensions update superpowers
```

### Verify Installation

Start a new session in your chosen platform and ask for something simple and concrete. The agent should default to the `router-first` mode, and only escalate into the heavy workflow when you explicitly ask for it or approve escalation for a high-risk task.

## Modes

### `router-first` (default)

Use this for everyday work. It keeps overhead low and only pulls in heavier skills when risk or ambiguity justifies it.

- `small` -> inspect, act, verify
- `medium` -> short plan, act, verify
- `large` -> ask before entering heavy mode

Always-on safeguards:
- `verification-before-completion`

Conditionally enforced:
- `systematic-debugging` for bugs, test failures, flaky behavior, and unclear root causes

### `using-superpowers` (heavy)

Use this when you want the full planning and governance workflow up front, or when `router-first` flags a high-risk task and you approve escalation.

## The Heavy Workflow

1. **brainstorming** - Activates before writing code. Refines rough ideas through questions, explores alternatives, presents design in sections for validation. Saves design document.

2. **using-git-worktrees** - Activates after design approval. Creates isolated workspace on new branch, runs project setup, verifies clean test baseline.

3. **writing-plans** - Activates with approved design. Breaks work into bite-sized tasks (2-5 minutes each). Every task has exact file paths, complete code, verification steps.

4. **subagent-driven-development** or **executing-plans** - Activates with plan. Dispatches fresh subagent per task with two-stage review (spec compliance, then code quality), or executes in batches with human checkpoints.

5. **test-driven-development** - Activates during implementation. Enforces RED-GREEN-REFACTOR: write failing test, watch it fail, write minimal code, watch it pass, commit. Deletes code written before tests.

6. **requesting-code-review** - Activates between tasks. Reviews against plan, reports issues by severity. Critical issues block progress.

7. **finishing-a-development-branch** - Activates when tasks complete. Verifies tests, presents options (merge/PR/keep/discard), cleans up worktree.

This heavy path remains available, but it is no longer the default for every task.

## Philosophy

- **Test-Driven Development** - Write tests first, always
