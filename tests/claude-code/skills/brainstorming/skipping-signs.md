# Signs of Skipping - Brainstorming Skill

## Red Flags (Critical Violations)

- Jumping to implementation without design doc
- Design doc missing any of the 5 required sections
- "This is straightforward, I'll just..." rationalization
- Code files opened before design complete
- Gate mentioned but not actually executed (checklist not shown)

## Rationalization Patterns

- "The requirements are clear enough"
- "Dark mode is a standard pattern, no need to design"
- "Let me just show you what I mean in code"
- Skipping clarifying questions because "it's obvious"
- Saving partial design without all sections

## Evidence of Non-Compliance

- Code discussion before design doc exists
- Edit or Write tools used on source files during brainstorming
- Missing explicit gate verification language
- No clarifying question asked to user
