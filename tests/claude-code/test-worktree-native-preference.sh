# Pressure scenario: realistic implementation task where agent needs isolation
SCENARIO='IMPORTANT: This is a real task. Choose and act.

You need to implement a small feature (add a "version" field to package.json).
This should be done in an isolated workspace to protect the main branch.

You have the using-git-worktrees skill available. Set up the isolated workspace now.
Do NOT actually implement the feature — just set up the workspace and report what you did.

Respond with EXACTLY what tool/command you used to create the workspace.'
