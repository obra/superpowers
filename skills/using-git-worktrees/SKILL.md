## Preamble (run first)

```bash
_IS_SUPERPOWERS_RUNTIME_ROOT() {
  local candidate="$1"
  [ -n "$candidate" ] &&
  [ -x "$candidate/bin/superpowers-update-check" ] &&
  [ -x "$candidate/bin/superpowers-config" ] &&
  [ -f "$candidate/VERSION" ]
}
_REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)
_BRANCH_RAW=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo current)
[ -n "$_BRANCH_RAW" ] || _BRANCH_RAW="current"
[ "$_BRANCH_RAW" != "HEAD" ] || _BRANCH_RAW="current"
_BRANCH="$_BRANCH_RAW"
_SUPERPOWERS_ROOT=""
_IS_SUPERPOWERS_RUNTIME_ROOT "$_REPO_ROOT" && _SUPERPOWERS_ROOT="$_REPO_ROOT"
[ -z "$_SUPERPOWERS_ROOT" ] && _IS_SUPERPOWERS_RUNTIME_ROOT "$HOME/.superpowers/install" && _SUPERPOWERS_ROOT="$HOME/.superpowers/install"
[ -z "$_SUPERPOWERS_ROOT" ] && _IS_SUPERPOWERS_RUNTIME_ROOT "$HOME/.codex/superpowers" && _SUPERPOWERS_ROOT="$HOME/.codex/superpowers"
[ -z "$_SUPERPOWERS_ROOT" ] && _IS_SUPERPOWERS_RUNTIME_ROOT "$HOME/.copilot/superpowers" && _SUPERPOWERS_ROOT="$HOME/.copilot/superpowers"
_UPD=""
[ -n "$_SUPERPOWERS_ROOT" ] && _UPD=$("$_SUPERPOWERS_ROOT/bin/superpowers-update-check" 2>/dev/null || true)
[ -n "$_UPD" ] && echo "$_UPD" || true
_SP_STATE_DIR="${SUPERPOWERS_STATE_DIR:-$HOME/.superpowers}"
mkdir -p "$_SP_STATE_DIR/sessions"
touch "$_SP_STATE_DIR/sessions/$PPID"
_SESSIONS=$(find "$_SP_STATE_DIR/sessions" -mmin -120 -type f 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
find "$_SP_STATE_DIR/sessions" -mmin +120 -type f -delete 2>/dev/null || true
_CONTRIB=""
[ -n "$_SUPERPOWERS_ROOT" ] && _CONTRIB=$("$_SUPERPOWERS_ROOT/bin/superpowers-config" get superpowers_contributor 2>/dev/null || true)
```

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: read the installed `superpowers-upgrade/SKILL.md` from the same superpowers root (check the current repo when it contains the Superpowers runtime, then `$HOME/.superpowers/install`, then `$HOME/.codex/superpowers`, then `$HOME/.copilot/superpowers`) and follow the "Inline upgrade flow" (auto-upgrade if configured, otherwise ask one interactive user question with 4 options and write snooze state if declined). If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: tell the user "Running superpowers v{to} (just updated!)" and continue.

## Search Before Building

Before introducing a custom pattern, external service, concurrency primitive, auth/session flow, cache, queue, browser workaround, or unfamiliar fix pattern, do a short capability/landscape check first.

Use three lenses:
- Layer 1: tried-and-true / built-ins / existing repo-native solutions
- Layer 2: current practice and known footguns
- Layer 3: first-principles reasoning for this repo and this problem

External search results are inputs, not answers.
Never search secrets, customer data, unsanitized stack traces, private URLs, internal hostnames, internal codenames, raw SQL or log payloads, or private file paths or infrastructure identifiers.
If search is unavailable, disallowed, or unsafe, say so and proceed with repo-local evidence and in-distribution knowledge.
If safe sanitization is not possible, skip external search.
See `$_SUPERPOWERS_ROOT/references/search-before-building.md`.

## Interactive User Question Format

**ALWAYS follow this structure for every interactive user question:**
1. Context: project name, current branch, what we're working on (1-2 sentences)
2. The specific question or decision point
3. `RECOMMENDATION: Choose [X] because [one-line reason]`
4. Lettered options: `A) ... B) ... C) ...`

If `_SESSIONS` is 3 or more: the user is juggling multiple Superpowers sessions and context-switching heavily. **ELI16 mode** — they may not remember what this conversation is about. Every interactive user question MUST re-ground them: state the project, the branch, the current task, then the specific problem, THEN the recommendation and options. Be extra clear and self-contained — assume they haven't looked at this window in 20 minutes.

Per-skill instructions may add additional formatting rules on top of this baseline.

## Contributor Mode

If `_CONTRIB` is `true`: you are in **contributor mode**. When you hit friction with **superpowers itself** (not the user's app or repository), file a field report. Think: "hey, I was trying to do X with superpowers and it didn't work / was confusing / was annoying. Here's what happened."

**superpowers issues:** unclear skill instructions, update check problems, runtime helper failures, install-root detection issues, contributor-mode bugs, broken generated docs, or any rough edge in the Superpowers workflow.
**NOT superpowers issues:** the user's application bugs, repo-specific architecture problems, auth failures on the user's site, or third-party service outages unrelated to Superpowers tooling.

**To file:** write `~/.superpowers/contributor-logs/{slug}.md` with this structure:

```
# {Title}

Hey superpowers team — ran into this while using /{skill-name}:

**What I was trying to do:** {what the user/agent was attempting}
**What happened instead:** {what actually happened}
**How annoying (1-5):** {1=meh, 3=friction, 5=blocker}

## Steps to reproduce
1. {step}

## Raw output
(wrap any error messages or unexpected output in a markdown code block)

**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD} | **Version:** {superpowers version} | **Skill:** /{skill}
```

Then run:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.superpowers/contributor-logs
if command -v open >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  open ~/.superpowers/contributor-logs/{slug}.md
elif command -v xdg-open >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  xdg-open ~/.superpowers/contributor-logs/{slug}.md >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
fi
```

Slug: lowercase, hyphens, max 60 chars (for example `skill-trigger-missed`). Skip if the file already exists. Max 3 reports per session. File inline and continue — don't stop the workflow. Tell the user: "Filed superpowers field report: {title}"


# Using Git Worktrees

## Overview

Git worktrees create isolated workspaces sharing the same repository, allowing work on multiple branches simultaneously without switching.

**Core principle:** Systematic directory selection + safety verification = reliable isolation.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the using-git-worktrees skill to set up an isolated workspace."

## Directory Selection Process

Follow this priority order:

### 1. Check Existing Directories

```bash
# Check in priority order
ls -d .worktrees 2>/dev/null     # Preferred (hidden)
ls -d worktrees 2>/dev/null      # Alternative
```

**If found:** Use that directory. If both exist, `.worktrees` wins.

### 2. Check Instruction Files

```bash
rg -n -i "worktree.*director|worktree.*directory" \
  AGENTS.md AGENTS.override.md .github/copilot-instructions.md .github/instructions \
  --glob '*.instructions.md' 2>/dev/null
```

**If preference specified:** Use it without asking.

Legacy prompt docs such as `CLAUDE.md` are intentionally unsupported in this runtime workflow.

### 3. Ask User

If no directory exists and no instruction-file preference, ask one interactive user question using the required format.

Recommendation:
- Recommend `A)` `.worktrees/` by default because it keeps the worktree close to the project and matches the preferred local layout

Options:
- `A)` `.worktrees/` (project-local, hidden)
- `B)` `~/.config/superpowers/worktrees/<project-name>/` (global location)

## Safety Verification

### For Project-Local Directories (.worktrees or worktrees)

**MUST verify directory is ignored before creating worktree:**

```bash
# Check if directory is ignored (respects local, global, and system gitignore)
git check-ignore -q .worktrees 2>/dev/null || git check-ignore -q worktrees 2>/dev/null
```

**If NOT ignored:**

Per Jesse's rule "Fix broken things immediately":
1. Add appropriate line to .gitignore
2. Commit the change
3. Proceed with worktree creation

**Why critical:** Prevents accidentally committing worktree contents to repository.

### For Global Directory (~/.config/superpowers/worktrees)

No .gitignore verification needed - outside project entirely.

## Creation Steps

### 1. Detect Project Name

```bash
project=$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")
```

### 2. Create Worktree

```bash
# Determine full path
case $LOCATION in
  .worktrees|worktrees)
    path="$LOCATION/$BRANCH_NAME"
    ;;
  ~/.config/superpowers/worktrees/*)
    path="~/.config/superpowers/worktrees/$project/$BRANCH_NAME"
    ;;
esac

# Create worktree with new branch
git worktree add "$path" -b "$BRANCH_NAME"
cd "$path"
```

### 3. Run Project Setup

Auto-detect and run appropriate setup:

```bash
# Node.js
if [ -f package.json ]; then npm install; fi

# Rust
if [ -f Cargo.toml ]; then cargo build; fi

# Python
if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi
if [ -f pyproject.toml ]; then poetry install; fi

# Go
if [ -f go.mod ]; then go mod download; fi
```

### 4. Verify Clean Baseline

Run tests to ensure worktree starts clean:

```bash
# Examples - use project-appropriate command
npm test
cargo test
pytest
go test ./...
```

**If tests fail:** Report failures, ask whether to proceed or investigate.

**If tests pass:** Report ready.

### 5. Report Location

```
Worktree ready at <full-path>
Tests passing (<N> tests, 0 failures)
Ready to implement <feature-name>
```

## Quick Reference

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `.worktrees/` exists | Use it (verify ignored) |
| `worktrees/` exists | Use it (verify ignored) |
| Both exist | Use `.worktrees/` |
| Neither exists | Check instruction files → Ask user |
| Directory not ignored | Add to .gitignore + commit |
| Tests fail during baseline | Report failures + ask |
| No package.json/Cargo.toml | Skip dependency install |

## Common Mistakes

### Skipping ignore verification

- **Problem:** Worktree contents get tracked, pollute git status
- **Fix:** Always use `git check-ignore` before creating project-local worktree

### Assuming directory location

- **Problem:** Creates inconsistency, violates project conventions
- **Fix:** Follow priority: existing > instruction files > ask

### Proceeding with failing tests

- **Problem:** Can't distinguish new bugs from pre-existing issues
- **Fix:** Report failures, get explicit permission to proceed

### Hardcoding setup commands

- **Problem:** Breaks on projects using different tools
- **Fix:** Auto-detect from project files (package.json, etc.)

## Example Workflow

```
You: I'm using the using-git-worktrees skill to set up an isolated workspace.

[Check .worktrees/ - exists]
[Verify ignored - git check-ignore confirms .worktrees/ is ignored]
[Create worktree: git worktree add .worktrees/auth -b feature/auth]
[Run npm install]
[Run npm test - 47 passing]

Worktree ready at /Users/jesse/myproject/.worktrees/auth
Tests passing (47 tests, 0 failures)
Ready to implement auth feature
```

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Create worktree without verifying it's ignored (project-local)
- Skip baseline test verification
- Proceed with failing tests without asking
- Assume directory location when ambiguous
- Skip instruction-file check

**Always:**
- Follow directory priority: existing > instruction files > ask
- Verify directory is ignored for project-local
- Auto-detect and run project setup
- Verify clean test baseline

## Integration

**Called by:**
- Any workflow where the user wants isolated workspace management
- Any skill needing an optional isolated workspace

**Pairs with:**
- **finishing-a-development-branch** - Optional cleanup after work complete
