# Local SEO Planning

## Overview

Local SEO is built on three pillars recognized by Google's local algorithm: **Relevance** (how well you match the query), **Distance** (proximity to searcher), and **Prominence** (reputation and authority). Success requires systematic planning with realistic timelines—initial results take 3-6 months, with significant gains visible in 6-12 months.

This skill provides a strategic framework for Local SEO Strategists to develop comprehensive plans, establish KPIs, and prioritize efforts for maximum impact.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Planning local SEO strategy for a business with physical location(s)
- Developing roadmap for service area businesses (SABs)
- Establishing KPIs and success metrics for local visibility
- Prioritizing local SEO tasks based on algorithm weighting
- Creating multi-phase implementation plans (3-12 month timelines)
- Optimizing for Google Local Pack and localized organic search

**Do NOT use for:**
- National/international SEO without local focus
- E-commerce without physical presence or service areas
- Quick tactical fixes (use for strategic planning instead)

## Strategic Foundation: The Three Pillars

Google's local algorithm evaluates businesses on three core factors:

| Pillar | What It Measures | How to Optimize |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Relevance** | How well business matches search query | Complete GBP, service-specific landing pages, schema markup |
| **Distance** | Proximity to searcher's location | Accurate address, service area definition, location-based content |
| **Prominence** | Reputation and authority | Reviews, citations, local backlinks, behavioral signals |

## Ranking Factor Distribution

Understanding where to focus effort based on impact:

| Ranking Factor | Local Pack (Map) | Localized Organic (Website) | Strategic Priority |
|----------------|------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| **Google Business Profile** | 32% | 9% | **Pillar 1: Immediate Foundation** |
| **On-Page Signals** | 19% | 36% | **Pillar 2: Organic Growth** |
| **Link Signals** | 11% | 26% | **Pillar 3: Long-Term Authority** |
| **Review Signals** | 16% | 6% | **High Impact/Ongoing** |

**Strategic Takeaway:** Dominate Local Pack with GBP optimization (32%). Capture long-term organic traffic with website content (36%).

## Phase 1: Diagnosis and KPI Definition (First 30 Days)

### Establish Conversion-Focused KPIs

Focus on revenue-generating actions, not vanity metrics:

**Google Business Profile Performance:**
- Views on listing
- Actions taken (calls, website clicks, direction requests)
- Click-through rate (CTR) from search

**Lead Generation:**
- Form submissions from localized landing pages
- Quote requests
- Mobile clicks-to-call
- Direction requests (brick-and-mortar)

**Organic Performance:**
- Traffic from unpaid local Google searches
- Keyword rankings for "[service] + [location]" terms

### Foundation Priority: NAP & GBP Accuracy

**NAP Consistency:**
- Standardize Name, Address, Phone across ALL platforms
- Resolve even minor inconsistencies ("St." vs "Street", "#100" vs "Suite 100")
- Audit directories: Yelp, Facebook, Apple Maps, industry-specific sites

**Initial GBP Checklist:**
- [ ] Claim and verify Google Business Profile
- [ ] Complete every field (website, hours, service areas, categories)
- [ ] Add high-quality photos (minimum 10, geo-tagged if possible)
- [ ] Write compelling business description with location keywords
- [ ] Set primary and secondary categories accurately

## Phase 2: Content Strategy and Keyword Targeting

### High-Intent Keyword Priorities

Target queries indicating ready-to-transact customers:

**1. "Near Me" Queries (Highest Intent)**
- Examples: "plumber near me", "invisalign near me", "emergency vet near me"
- These searchers are often ready to buy, book, or visit immediately

**2. Conversational/Long-Tail (Voice Search)**
- Examples: "Who offers air conditioner repair near me?", "Where can I get same-day dental crown?"
- Tools: AnswerThePublic, Semrush Keyword Magic Tool

**3. Location-First Searches**
- Examples: "Austin web designer", "Chicago personal injury lawyer"
- Note: Many users search location-first, not location-last

### Service Area Pages (SAPs) Strategy

For businesses serving multiple locations, create dedicated landing pages:

**Page Structure Requirements:**
- Separate page for each major service + location combination
- Example: "Roof Repair in [City A]", "HVAC Installation in [City B]"

**Uniqueness Mandate (Critical):**
- Every SAP must be unique and customer-centric
- Avoid simple city name swaps in boilerplate text
- Google flags duplicate content as "doorway pages" (penalized)

**Localization Details to Include:**
- Local landmarks and neighborhood names
- Regional issues/concerns (e.g., "Hurricane-Proof Roofing for Miami Homes")
- Local customer testimonials
- City-specific service details or pricing

**On-Page SEO Integration:**
- URL: `/services/roof-repair-dallas-tx/`
- Title Tag: "Roof Repair in Dallas, TX | [Company Name]"
- Meta Description: Include location and call-to-action
- H1: "Professional Roof Repair Services in Dallas, Texas"
- Natural keyword integration throughout content

## Phase 3: Technical & Authority Building

### Implement Structured Data (Schema & KML)

Technical optimization connects business identity to web content:

**LocalBusiness Schema (JSON-LD):**
Implement on homepage, contact page, or location pages with minimum fields:
- Business name
- Address
- Phone number
- URL
- Geo coordinates (latitude/longitude)

**AI Readiness:**
Accurate schema helps Google's AI Overviews pull correct information, enhancing SERP presence and trust.

**KML File Integration (Advanced):**
For Service Area Businesses, create KML (Keyhole Markup Language) file:
- Contains precise location data and service areas
- Link in LocalBusiness schema via `additionalProperty` field
- Provides advanced geographic signaling

**Map Embedding:**
Embed Google Map on Contact/About page to reinforce local signals.

### Systematize Review Management

Review signals = 16% of Local Pack ranking. Reviews older than 3 months lose relevance.

**Acquisition Strategy:**
- Automated system to request reviews 24-48 hours after service
- Send direct link to Google Business Profile
- Email or SMS delivery

**Response Strategy:**
- Respond to EVERY review (positive and negative)
- Shows engagement and customer care (strong SEO signal)
- Professional, helpful responses build trust

**Keyword Encouragement:**
Encourage customers to mention specific service and location in reviews for keyword-rich, credible validation.

### Build Hyperlocal Authority

Link signals = 26% of localized organic ranking factors.

**Citation Management (Quarterly Audit):**
- Ensure 100% NAP consistency across:
  - Yelp, Facebook, Apple Maps
  - Industry directories (HomeAdvisor, BBB, Angi)
  - Local chambers of commerce
- Consistency verifies legitimacy and builds trust

**Local Link Building Priorities:**
- Geographic relevance > generic national links
- Local newspapers and media outlets
- Community organizations
- Industry associations
- Local business partnerships

**Link Acquisition Tactics:**
- Sponsor local events or sports teams (generates backlinks)
- Local PR: Pitch newsworthy stories to media
- Community involvement and partnerships
- Guest contributions to local publications

## Phase 4: Monitoring and Adaptation

### Track Behavioral Signals

Google monitors user interaction with listings to determine rankings:

**Key Metrics to Analyze:**
- Click-through rate (CTR) from search results
- Mobile clicks-to-call
- Direction requests
- Website clicks from GBP
- Time on site from local search traffic

**Improve Clickability:**
- High-quality, regularly updated photos
- Active Google Posts (promotions, events, updates)
- Compelling business description
- Accurate business hours and attributes

### AI Search Optimization

**AI Overviews Impact:**
- May reduce traditional link clicks
- Emphasizes accurate, structured business data
- Pulls from authoritative, well-marked sources

**Optimization for AI:**
- Complete, accurate GBP data
- Proper schema markup implementation
- Strong third-party validation (reviews, citations)

**Bing Places Optimization:**
- Powers local search in ChatGPT and other AI tools
- Optimize Bing Places for Business profile
- Generate reviews on Bing-aggregated platforms (Yelp, Facebook)

## Maintenance Schedule

Local SEO requires consistent, ongoing effort:

| Frequency | Tasks | Strategic Goal |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **Weekly** | • Publish Google Posts<br>• Upload geo-tagged photos/videos<br>• Monitor and respond to reviews | Maintain GBP activity signals |
| **Monthly** | • GBP audit and optimization<br>• Review analytics (calls, clicks, keywords)<br>• Publish localized blog content | Refine based on performance data |
| **Quarterly** | • Comprehensive NAP audit<br>• Review and update Service Area Pages<br>• Citation building campaign | Ensure data integrity across web |
| **Semi-Annually** | • Technical SEO audit (speed, mobile)<br>• Backlink profile review<br>• Competitor analysis | Maintain technical foundation |

## Strategic Analogy

A local business's digital presence is like a meticulously maintained city park:

- **Google Business Profile (32% ranking factor)** = Main entrance sign—must be polished, accurate, and prominent
- **Website content/SAPs (36% organic ranking)** = Network of walking trails—unique, useful paths for researching visitors
- **Reviews and backlinks** = Historical statues and plaques—confirm the park's respected reputation within the community

If any component falls into disrepair, the park's ability to attract visitors and build trust diminishes.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Impact | Solution |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Inconsistent NAP data | Confuses search engines, dilutes authority | Standardize across all platforms immediately |
| Duplicate SAP content | Penalized as "doorway pages" | Create unique, localized content for each page |
| Ignoring reviews | Missed 16% ranking factor + trust signals | Implement automated request + response system |
| National links only | Lower relevance for local algorithm | Prioritize geographically relevant backlinks |
| Set-and-forget GBP | Stale signals reduce prominence | Weekly posts, monthly audits, continuous optimization |
| Vanity metrics focus | Optimizing for views instead of conversions | Track revenue-generating actions (calls, forms, visits) |
