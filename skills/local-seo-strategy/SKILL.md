# Local SEO Strategy

## Overview

Strategic content creation for local SEO dominance, focusing on "people-first" content that matches local search intent while optimizing for search engines and AI systems. Local SEO accounts for 36% of organic ranking from on-page content and 26% from local links.

**Core principle:** Create unique, helpful content for each location that serves customers first and search engines second, avoiding spam penalties while maximizing local visibility.

**Foundational rule:** The requirements in this skill (6 content types, calculated keyword density, pre-launch checklist) are not optional "best practices" or "nice-to-haves." They are minimum requirements to avoid Google penalties that can deindex entire service area page networks. Skipping them isn't being pragmatic or flexible - it's risking catastrophic SEO failure.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Creating service area pages (SAPs) or location landing pages
- Writing local business content for geographic expansion
- Optimizing existing pages for local search rankings
- Creating content for businesses without physical locations in target areas
- Need to avoid Google doorway page penalties
- Building Google Business Profile content
- Creating local blog posts or neighborhood-specific content

**Don't use for:**
- National/global SEO campaigns without local focus
- E-commerce product pages (unless location-specific)
- General brand content without geographic targeting

## Phase 1: Search Intent and Localization

### High-Intent Local Keywords

**Priority:** Target transactional mindset customers ready to buy, book, or visit.

**Voice Search First (58% of consumers use voice):**
- Optimize for conversational, question-based queries
- Example: "What are the best AC repair companies near me?"
- Use tools like AnswerThePublic for long-tail questions

**Location-First Language:**
- Pattern: "Austin Web Designer" > "Web Designer Austin TX"
- Integrate into page titles and headings naturally

**Intent Phases (prioritize transactional):**
- Navigational: Finding specific business
- Informational: Learning about services
- **Transactional: Ready to buy/book (highest conversion)**
- Commercial: Comparing options

### "People-First" Content (Avoid Spam)

**Critical Rules:**

| Rule | Implementation | Why |
|------|----------------|-----|
| **Keyword Density <5%** | MANDATORY: Calculate (keyword count / total words) × 100 for EACH target keyword | Above 5% triggers spam penalties, deranking |
| **"Near You" vs "Near Me"** | Use "near you" in copy, both work algorithmically | "Near you" reads more naturally |
| **Testimonial Strategy** | Ask customers: "How did you find us?" | Natural "near me" incorporation |

**IMPORTANT:** You cannot "eyeball" keyword density. You must calculate it mathematically. Even experienced copywriters misjudge density without calculation.

**Example Testimonial:**
> "I searched for 'dentist near me' and found ABC Dental. Best decision ever!" – Sarah M., Austin

## Phase 2: Hyperlocal Landing Pages

### Mandate Uniqueness (Avoid Doorway Pages)

**Critical:** Google penalizes "substantially similar pages" as doorway pages. Each location page MUST have unique, helpful content.

**WARNING:** Missing even ONE of these 6 content types puts your entire service area page network at risk of deindexing. These are PRE-LAUNCH requirements, not post-launch enhancements.

**6 Required Content Types Per Location (ALL MANDATORY):**

| Content Type | Localization Required | Example |
|--------------|----------------------|---------|
| **Project Showcases** | Images/video from target city with before/after | "Kitchen renovation in South Austin" |
| **Reviews/Testimonials** | From customers in that specific city | "Austin customer since 2023" |
| **City-Specific Expertise** | Regional problems, local tips, unique challenges | "Austin's hard water requires..." |
| **Service Menus/Offers** | Rotating deals specific to service area | "Cedar Park residents: 15% off" |
| **Community Proofs** | Local awards, news mentions, hyperlocal blogs | "Featured in Austin Chronicle" |
| **B2B Cross-Promotion** | Partner with local businesses for referrals | "Recommended by Austin Realty Co." |

### Conversion-Focused Design

**Page Essentials:**
- City name in: URL, Title Tag, throughout text
- **Contact Priority:** Phone (local area code), booking calendar, contact form, hours
- **FAQ Section:** Common pre-purchase questions (triggers featured snippets, AI Overviews)
- **Bold CTAs:** "Schedule Demo," "Book Appointment," "Call Now"

**Example URL Structure:**
- ✅ Good: `/service-areas/austin-texas/` or `/austin-hvac-repair/`
- ❌ Bad: `/locations/tx/001/` (no keywords)

## Phase 3: On-Page Optimization

### Title Tags, Meta, Headers (36% of ranking importance)

**Optimization Checklist:**

| Element | Best Practice | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| **Title Tag** | 55-70 chars, keyword early | "AC Repair Austin TX – Elite HVAC Services" |
| **Meta Description** | 150-160 chars, include CTA | "24/7 AC repair in Austin. EPA certified. Free estimates. Same-day service. Call now!" |
| **H1** | Location keyword above fold | "Professional AC Repair Services in Austin, Texas" |
| **H2/H3** | Organize with local keywords | "Why Austin Homeowners Choose Us" |

**Keyword Placement Priority:**
1. Title Tag (most important)
2. H1 (above the fold)
3. First paragraph
4. URL slug
5. Meta description

### Visual Content (2/5 users prefer images over text)

**Image Requirements:**
- **Types:** Before/after photos, process videos, team photos
- **File Names:** `austin-kitchen-renovation.jpg` > `IMG_2847.jpg`
- **Alt Text:** Descriptive with location keywords
- **Geo-Tagging:** Upload geo-tagged photos (strengthens local signals)
- **Frequency:** Regular updates signal active, trustworthy business

### Structured Data (Schema)

**Minimum Required for LocalBusiness Schema:**
- Business name
- Phone number (local area code preferred)
- Address
- Website URL
- Hours of operation
- Geo coordinates (latitude/longitude)

**FAQ Schema:**
- Triggers rich results in SERPs
- Increases visibility for conversational queries
- Place on relevant pages with common questions

## Phase 4: Supporting Content

### Google Business Profile (GBP)

**Critical Content (often first impression):**

| Element | Specification | Strategy |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| **Description** | Max 750 characters | Use all space, natural keywords |
| **Google Posts** | Weekly minimum | Promotions, events, service updates |
| **Products/Services** | Individual entries | Descriptive, with prices, keywords |
| **Q&A Section** | Proactive answers | Write/post common questions yourself |

### Link Building Content (26% of ranking importance)

**Tactics:**
- **Community Involvement:** Document sponsorships, charity events in blog posts
- **Local PR:** Offer expert commentary to local news, generate backlinks
- **Pitch:** Send to local media outlets for coverage

## Content Production

### Timeline Expectations

**Initial Results:** 3-6 months (first ranking improvements)
**Significant Gains:** 6-12 months (consistent content + optimization)

### Cost Ranges (Typical Agency Pricing)

| Content Type | Cost Per Piece | Monthly Volume |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Local Blog Posts** | $150-500 | 4-8 posts |
| **Location Landing Pages** | $300-800 | 2-4 pages |
| **Service Area Pages** | $200-600 | 3-5 pages |

## Red Flags - STOP and Fix Before Launch

If you're doing any of these, STOP and fix before publishing:

- "I'll calculate keyword density after publishing" → Calculate NOW or risk spam penalty
- "I'll add unique content later" → Google indexes immediately, doorway penalty applies
- "Close enough on the 6 content types" → Missing even ONE triggers doorway page risk
- "I can eyeball keyword density" → You can't. Calculate: (keyword count / total words) × 100
- "Generic is fine, I changed a few words" → Google detects substantially similar pages
- "I'll skip geo-tagging photos" → You lose critical local ranking signals
- "I don't have time for testimonials" → Without them, page lacks required uniqueness
- "FAQ Schema is optional" → You forfeit rich results and voice search visibility
- "Publish now, do a quick SEO tune-up later" → These aren't tune-ups, they're core requirements
- "80% complete is good enough" → No. Incomplete pages risk doorway penalties for entire network
- "Being pragmatic not dogmatic" → Skipping requirements isn't pragmatic, it's gambling with SEO penalties
- "Perfect is the enemy of good" → These aren't perfection, they're minimum requirements for ranking
- "Experienced professionals can skip the calculations" → No. Experience doesn't eliminate spam penalties

**All of these mean: Don't launch the page yet. Complete the checklist first.**

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix | Impact |
|---------|-----|--------|
| **Keyword stuffing (>5% density)** | Calculate density, use synonyms | Spam penalty, lower rankings |
| **Generic location pages** | Add 6 unique content types per location | Avoid doorway page penalty |
| **Using "near me" in copy** | Replace with "near you" | Better readability, same ranking |
| **No voice search optimization** | Add conversational, question-based content | Miss 58% of consumer searches |
| **Ignoring GBP Q&A** | Proactively write questions/answers | Lose visibility, competitor fills gap |
| **Stock photos only** | Use geo-tagged local photos/videos | Weaker local signals, less trust |
| **Missing FAQ Schema** | Implement on key pages | No rich results, lower CTR |
| **Same offers across locations** | Rotate city-specific deals | Looks like doorway page to Google |
