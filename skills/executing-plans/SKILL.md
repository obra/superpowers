# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute all tasks continuously, report when complete or blocked.

**Core principle:** Continuous execution with stops only for blockers or ambiguity.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan
1. Read plan file
2. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan
3. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting
4. If no concerns: Create TodoWrite and proceed

### Step 2: Execute All Tasks Continuously

Execute each task in sequence:
1. Mark as in_progress
2. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
3. Run verifications as specified
4. Mark as completed
5. Move immediately to next task

**Continue executing until:**
- All tasks complete, OR
- You hit a blocker (see "When to Stop and Ask for Help" below)

**Do NOT stop between tasks to ask for feedback unless blocked.**

## Common Rationalizations for Stopping (Don't Do These)

**STOP means blocked, not:**
- ❌ "Completed several tasks, should check in"
- ❌ "Next tasks look complex, should get feedback first"
- ❌ "Been working a while, should pause"
- ❌ "Want to show progress"
- ❌ "Significant milestone reached"

**Unless blocked or unclear: keep executing.**

### Step 3: Report When Complete

After all tasks complete and verified:
- Show what was implemented
- Show verification output
- Announce: "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch
- Follow that skill to verify tests, present options, execute choice

## When to Stop and Ask for Help

**STOP executing immediately when:**
- Hit a blocker mid-execution (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**

## When to Revisit Earlier Steps

**Return to Review (Step 1) when:**
- Partner updates the plan after you've reported blockers
- Fundamental approach needs rethinking mid-execution

**Don't force through blockers** - stop and ask.

## Remember
- Review plan critically first
- Execute all tasks continuously (don't pause between tasks)
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Reference skills when plan says to
- Stop ONLY when blocked or need clarification, don't guess
