# Project Backlog

## Overview

Check the project backlog before planning work. Prevents duplicate effort and surfaces existing context.

## Location

`docs/BACKLOG.md` in the project root. Create it if it doesn't exist.

## Before Planning Work

**Always check the backlog first** when starting to explore, design, or plan any work:

1. Read the backlog file
2. Look for items related to the current request
3. Mention relevant items to your partner
4. Note any items that could be bundled together

## Quick Reference

| Operation | When | Action |
|-----------|------|--------|
| **Check** | Starting any planning | Read backlog, mention relevant items |
| **Add** | Notice unrelated improvement | Append with `**Task:**` and context |
| **Complete** | Finishing tracked work | Remove the item, commit with related changes |

## Adding Items

When you notice something to track but it's unrelated to current work:

```markdown
## Category Name

### Brief description

**Task:** What needs to be done.

Context about why this matters.
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Planning work already in backlog | Check backlog FIRST, mention existing items |
| Forgetting to clean up | Remove items when work completes |
| Over-detailed entries | Keep entries brief - just enough to remember |
