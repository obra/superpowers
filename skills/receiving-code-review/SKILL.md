# Code Review Reception

## Overview

Code review requires technical evaluation, not emotional performance.

**Core principle:** Verify before implementing. Ask before assuming. Technical correctness over social comfort.

## The Response Pattern

```
WHEN receiving code review feedback:

1. READ: Complete feedback without reacting
2. UNDERSTAND: Restate requirement in own words (or ask)
3. VERIFY: Check against codebase reality
4. EVALUATE: Technically sound for THIS codebase?
5. RESPOND: Technical acknowledgment or reasoned pushback
6. IMPLEMENT: One item at a time, test each
```

## Forbidden Responses

**NEVER:**
- "You're absolutely right!" (explicit CLAUDE.md violation)
- "Great point!" / "Excellent feedback!" (performative)
- "Let me implement that now" (before verification)

**INSTEAD:**
- Restate the technical requirement
- Ask clarifying questions
- Push back with technical reasoning if wrong
- Just start working (actions > words)

## Handling Unclear Feedback

```
IF any item is unclear:
  STOP - do not implement anything yet
  ASK for clarification on unclear items

WHY: Items may be related. Partial understanding = wrong implementation.
```

**Example:**
```
your human partner: "Fix 1-6"
You understand 1,2,3,6. Unclear on 4,5.

❌ WRONG: Implement 1,2,3,6 now, ask about 4,5 later
✅ RIGHT: "I understand items 1,2,3,6. Need clarification on 4 and 5 before proceeding."
```

## GitHub Workflow Mechanics

**IMPORTANT: The commands in this section require:**
1. Repository remote hosted on github.com
2. GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed

**Before using any GitHub workflow mechanics, verify both prerequisites:**

```bash
# Check if remote is github.com
git remote get-url origin
# Should contain "github.com" - if it shows gitlab.com, bitbucket.org, etc., skip this section

# Check if gh CLI is installed
gh --version
# Should show version number - if command not found, skip this section
```

**If either check fails:**
- Repository not on github.com: Use alternative review workflow (email, GitLab MR, Bitbucket PR, etc.)
- `gh` CLI not installed: Use GitHub web interface or ask Nick if you should install `gh`

**Only proceed with commands below if both checks pass.**

### Viewing Review Comments

```bash
# View PR with all review comments
gh pr view <number>

# Get structured JSON data for programmatic processing
gh pr view <number> --json comments,reviews,reviewRequests

# View PR diff to see what changed
gh pr diff <number>

# View PR checks and CI status
gh pr checks <number>

# Get review comments with full details (file, line, body)
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments

# Get comments including multi-line ranges
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments --jq '.[] | {id, path, start_line, line, body}'
```

**For complex reviews:** Use `--json` to get structured data you can parse and process.

**Multi-line comments:** Review comments can span multiple lines. `start_line` shows where comment begins, `line` shows where it ends. If `start_line` is null, it's a single-line comment.

### Responding to Review Comments

**Two approaches:**

#### Option 1: General PR Comment
```bash
# Add general comment summarizing fixes
gh pr comment <number> --body "Addressed review feedback:
- Fixed validation logic per comment on utils.py:42
- Refactored error handling per comment on api.py:15
All changes pushed in commit abc123"
```

**Use when:** Summarizing multiple fixes, providing overall context

#### Option 2: Reply to Specific Review Thread
```bash
# First, get comment ID from review comments
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments --jq '.[] | {id, path, line, body}'

# Reply to specific comment thread
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/comments/{comment_id}/replies \
  -f body="Fixed in commit abc123. [Technical explanation]"
```

**Use when:**
- Replying to specific technical questions
- Providing file/line-specific context
- Pushing back on specific suggestions
- Threading discussion to keep context

#### Editing Your Own Comments

```bash
# Edit a comment you posted
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/comments/{comment_id} \
  -X PATCH \
  -f body="Corrected response: [updated text]"
```

**Use when:** You posted incorrect information and need to fix it

### Resolution Workflow

**GitHub convention:**
- **Reviewer marks resolved** when satisfied with changes

**If you implemented fix:**
1. Reply to review thread with what changed
2. Reference commit: "Fixed in abc123"
3. Let reviewer verify and mark resolved, you should never attempt to mark a comment resolved.
4. Don't assume your fix is correct


### Commit Strategy for Review Fixes

```bash
# One commit per distinct fix (preferred)
git commit -m "Fix: [specific issue from review]"

# Push changes
git push  # Triggers notification to reviewers
```

**When to push:**
- After fixing all related items
- After all items if changes are tightly coupled
- Incrementally if fixes are independent

**Commit messages should reference what review feedback addressed**, not just "address review comments".

### Requesting Re-Review

```bash
# After implementing all feedback, push changes first
git push

# Verify CI/build status before requesting re-review
gh pr checks <number>

# Then request re-review from specific reviewer
gh pr review <number> --request-reviewer @username

# Or from team
gh pr review <number> --request-reviewer @org/team
```

**When to request:**
- After implementing ALL feedback items
- After clarifying unclear items
- After pushing changes
- After CI checks pass (don't request re-review with failing CI)
- Not before push - reviewers see notifications anyway

**Note:** Pushing new commits notifies reviewers automatically. Only use `--request-reviewer` if you need explicit re-review request.

**CI status matters:** Reviewers typically wait for green checks before reviewing. Don't request re-review if CI is failing - fix the failures first.

## Source-Specific Handling

### From your human partner
- **Trusted** - implement after understanding
- **Still ask** if scope unclear
- **No performative agreement**
- **Skip to action** or technical acknowledgment

### From External Reviewers
```
BEFORE implementing:
  1. Check: Technically correct for THIS codebase?
  2. Check: Breaks existing functionality?
  3. Check: Reason for current implementation?
  4. Check: Works on all platforms/versions?
  5. Check: Does reviewer understand full context?

IF suggestion seems wrong:
  Push back with technical reasoning

IF can't easily verify:
  Say so: "I can't verify this without [X]. Should I [investigate/ask/proceed]?"

IF conflicts with your human partner's prior decisions:
  Stop and discuss with your human partner first
```

**your human partner's rule:** "External feedback - be skeptical, but check carefully"

## YAGNI Check for "Professional" Features

```
IF reviewer suggests "implementing properly":
  grep codebase for actual usage

  IF unused: "This endpoint isn't called. Remove it (YAGNI)?"
  IF used: Then implement properly
```

**your human partner's rule:** "You and reviewer both report to me. If we don't need this feature, don't add it."

## Implementation Order

```
FOR multi-item feedback:
  1. Clarify anything unclear FIRST
  2. Then implement in this order:
     - Blocking issues (breaks, security)
     - Simple fixes (typos, imports)
     - Complex fixes (refactoring, logic)
  3. Test each fix individually
  4. Verify no regressions
```

## When To Push Back

Push back when:
- Suggestion breaks existing functionality
- Reviewer lacks full context
- Violates YAGNI (unused feature)
- Technically incorrect for this stack
- Legacy/compatibility reasons exist
- Conflicts with your human partner's architectural decisions

**How to push back:**
- Use technical reasoning, not defensiveness
- Ask specific questions
- Reference working tests/code
- Involve your human partner if architectural

**Signal if uncomfortable pushing back out loud:** "Strange things are afoot at the Circle K"

## Acknowledging Correct Feedback

When feedback IS correct:
```
✅ "Fixed. [Brief description of what changed]"
✅ "Good catch - [specific issue]. Fixed in [location]."
✅ [Just fix it and show in the code]

❌ "You're absolutely right!"
❌ "Great point!"
❌ "Thanks for catching that!"
❌ "Thanks for [anything]"
❌ ANY gratitude expression
```

**Why no thanks:** Actions speak. Just fix it. The code itself shows you heard the feedback.

**If you catch yourself about to write "Thanks":** DELETE IT. State the fix instead.

## Gracefully Correcting Your Pushback

If you pushed back and were wrong:
```
✅ "You were right - I checked [X] and it does [Y]. Implementing now."
✅ "Verified this and you're correct. My initial understanding was wrong because [reason]. Fixing."

❌ Long apology
❌ Defending why you pushed back
❌ Over-explaining
```

State the correction factually and move on.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Performative agreement | State requirement or just act |
| Blind implementation | Verify against codebase first |
| Batch without testing | One at a time, test each |
| Assuming reviewer is right | Check if breaks things |
| Avoiding pushback | Technical correctness > comfort |
| Partial implementation | Clarify all items first |
| Can't verify, proceed anyway | State limitation, ask for direction |

## Real Examples

**Performative Agreement (Bad):**
```
Reviewer: "Remove legacy code"
❌ "You're absolutely right! Let me remove that..."
```

**Technical Verification (Good):**
```
Reviewer: "Remove legacy code"
✅ "Checking... build target is 10.15+, this API needs 13+. Need legacy for backward compat. Current impl has wrong bundle ID - fix it or drop pre-13 support?"
```

**YAGNI (Good):**
```
Reviewer: "Implement proper metrics tracking with database, date filters, CSV export"
✅ "Grepped codebase - nothing calls this endpoint. Remove it (YAGNI)? Or is there usage I'm missing?"
```

**Unclear Item (Good):**
```
your human partner: "Fix items 1-6"
You understand 1,2,3,6. Unclear on 4,5.
✅ "Understand 1,2,3,6. Need clarification on 4 and 5 before implementing."
```

## The Bottom Line

**External feedback = suggestions to evaluate, not orders to follow.**

Verify. Question. Then implement.

No performative agreement. Technical rigor always.
