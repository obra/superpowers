## Subagent dispatch requires multi-agent support

Add to your Codex config (`~/.codex/config.toml`):

```toml
[features]
multi_agent = true
```

This enables the multi-agent tools that skills like
`dispatching-parallel-agents` and `subagent-driven-development` use.
Which tools you get depends on the multi-agent version your model
preset selects (current presets run V2; older ones run V1). Trust your
actual tool list over any table — including this one — when they
disagree.

- **Spawning:** give children a clean context with
  `spawn_agent {fork_turns: "none"}`; the default `"all"` copies your
  entire transcript into the child. On Codex 0.145+, role files under
  `~/.codex/agents/` attach to isolated forks via `agent_type`.
  Full-history forks accept `model` and `reasoning_effort` overrides
  (only `agent_type` is refused there) — isolated forks are the SDD
  default for context hygiene, not because overrides require them.
- **Fix rounds:** resume the implementer with `followup_task` — it
  delivers your message, triggers a turn, and transparently reloads a
  child the harness evicted. Never dispatch a fresh implementer on the
  theory that a spawned agent cannot be messaged again; on V2 it
  always can.
- **Lifecycle:** V2 has no `close_agent`. Finished children are
  evicted automatically when slots are needed; leaving them unclosed
  costs nothing. Only V1 sessions have `close_agent` — there, close
  reviewers when their review returns, and close each implementer
  after its task's review passes.
- **Model names:** never copy a model name from a skill, table, or old
  session into `spawn_agent` without checking it against your current
  spawn allowlist — V2 accepts only V2-capable presets and hard-errors
  on the rest.

## Environment Detection

Skills that create worktrees or finish branches should detect their
environment with read-only git commands before proceeding:

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
GIT_COMMON=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
```

- `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON` → already in a linked worktree (skip creation)
- `BRANCH` empty → detached HEAD (cannot branch/push/PR from sandbox)

See `using-git-worktrees` Step 0 and `finishing-a-development-branch`
Step 1 for how each skill uses these signals.

## Codex App Finishing

When the sandbox blocks branch/push operations (detached HEAD in an
externally managed worktree), the agent commits all work and informs
the user to use the App's native controls:

- **"Create branch"** — names the branch, then commit/push/PR via App UI
- **"Hand off to local"** — transfers work to the user's local checkout

The agent can still run tests, stage files, and output suggested branch
names, commit messages, and PR descriptions for the user to copy.
