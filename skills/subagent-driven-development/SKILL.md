# Subagent-Driven Development

Execute plan by dispatching fresh subagent per task, with code review after each.

**Core principle:** Fresh subagent per task + review between tasks = high quality, fast iteration

## Overview

**vs. Executing Plans (parallel session):**
- Same session (no context switch)
- Fresh subagent per task (no context pollution)
- Code review after each task (catch issues early)
- Faster iteration (no human-in-loop between tasks)

**When to use:**
- Staying in this session
- Tasks are mostly independent
- Want continuous progress with quality gates

**When NOT to use:**
- Need to review plan first (use executing-plans)
- Tasks are tightly coupled (manual execution better)
- Plan needs revision (brainstorm first)

## The Process

### 1. Load Plan

1. Read plan file once
2. Extract all tasks (full text of each)
3. For each task, note scene-setting context:
   - Where it fits in overall plan
   - Dependencies on previous tasks
   - Architectural context
   - Relevant patterns or existing code to follow
4. Create TodoWrite with all tasks

### 2. Execute Task with Subagent

For each task:

**1. Prepare task context:**
- Get the full text of Task N (already extracted in Step 1)
- Get the scene-setting context (already noted in Step 1)

**2. Dispatch fresh subagent with full task text:**
```
Task tool (general-purpose):
  description: "Implement Task N: [task name]"
  prompt: |
    You are implementing Task N: [task name]

    ## Task Description

    [FULL TEXT of task from plan - paste it here, don't make subagent read file]

    ## Context

    [Scene-setting: where this fits, dependencies, architectural context]

    ## Before You Begin

    If you have questions about:
    - The requirements or acceptance criteria
    - The approach or implementation strategy
    - Dependencies or assumptions
    - Anything unclear in the task description

    **Ask them now.** Raise any concerns before starting work.

    ## Your Job

    Once you're clear on requirements:
    1. Implement exactly what the task specifies
    2. Write tests (following TDD if task says to)
    3. Verify implementation works
    4. Commit your work
    5. Self-review (see below)
    6. Report back

    Work from: [directory]

    **While you work:** If you encounter something unexpected or unclear, **ask questions**.
    It's always OK to pause and clarify. Don't guess or make assumptions.

    ## Before Reporting Back: Self-Review

    Review your work with fresh eyes. Ask yourself:

    **Completeness:**
    - Did I fully implement everything in the spec?
    - Did I miss any requirements?
    - Are there edge cases I didn't handle?

    **Quality:**
    - Is this my best work?
    - Are names clear and accurate (match what things do, not how they work)?
    - Is the code clean and maintainable?

    **Discipline:**
    - Did I avoid overbuilding (YAGNI)?
    - Did I only build what was requested?
    - Did I follow existing patterns in the codebase?

    **Testing:**
    - Do tests actually verify behavior (not just mock behavior)?
    - Did I follow TDD if required?
    - Are tests comprehensive?

    If you find issues during self-review, fix them now before reporting.

    ## Report Format

    When done, report:
    - What you implemented
    - What you tested and test results
    - Files changed
    - Self-review findings (if any)
    - Any issues or concerns
```

**3. Handle subagent response:**

If subagent asks questions:
- Answer clearly
- Provide additional context if needed
- Either continue conversation or re-dispatch with answers

If subagent proceeds with implementation:
- Review their report
- Proceed to spec compliance review (Step 3)

### 3. Spec Compliance Review

**Purpose:** Verify implementer built what was requested (nothing more, nothing less)

**Dispatch spec compliance reviewer:**
```
Task tool (general-purpose):
  description: "Review spec compliance for Task N"
  prompt: |
    You are reviewing whether an implementation matches its specification.

    ## What Was Requested

    [FULL TEXT of task requirements]

    ## What Was Implemented

    [From implementer's report]

    ## Your Job

    Check for:

    **Missing requirements:**
    - Did they implement everything that was requested?
    - Are there requirements they skipped or missed?

    **Extra/unneeded work:**
    - Did they build things that weren't requested?
    - Did they over-engineer or add unnecessary features?

    **Misunderstandings:**
    - Did they interpret requirements differently than intended?
    - Did they solve the wrong problem?

    Read the implementation code to verify.

    Report:
    - ✅ Spec compliant (if everything matches)
    - ❌ Issues found: [list what's missing or extra]
```

**Review loop:**
1. Spec reviewer reports findings
2. If issues found:
   - Original implementer fixes issues
   - Spec reviewer reviews again
3. Repeat until spec compliant

### 4. Code Quality Review

**Purpose:** Verify implementation is well-built (clean, tested, maintainable)

**Dispatch code-reviewer subagent:**
```
Task tool (superpowers:code-reviewer):
  Use template at requesting-code-review/code-reviewer.md

  WHAT_WAS_IMPLEMENTED: [from implementer's report]
  PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS: Task N from [plan-file]
  BASE_SHA: [commit before task]
  HEAD_SHA: [current commit]
  DESCRIPTION: [task summary]
```

**Code reviewer returns:** Strengths, Issues (Critical/Important/Minor), Assessment

**Review loop:**
1. Code reviewer reports findings
2. If issues found:
   - Original implementer fixes issues
   - Code reviewer reviews again
3. Repeat until code quality approved

### 5. Mark Complete, Next Task

- Mark task as completed in TodoWrite
- Move to next task
- Repeat steps 2-5 for each remaining task

### 6. Final Review

After all tasks complete, dispatch final code-reviewer:
- Reviews entire implementation
- Checks all plan requirements met
- Validates overall architecture

### 7. Complete Development

After final review passes:
- Announce: "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch
- Follow that skill to verify tests, present options, execute choice

## Example Workflow

```
You: I'm using Subagent-Driven Development to execute this plan.

[Read plan file once: docs/plans/feature-plan.md]
[Extract all 5 tasks with full text and context]
[Create TodoWrite with all tasks]

Task 1: Hook installation script

[Get Task 1 text and context (already extracted)]
[Dispatch implementation subagent with full task text + context]

Implementer: "Before I begin - should the hook be installed at user or system level?"

You: "User level (~/.config/superpowers/hooks/)"

Implementer: "Got it. Implementing now..."
[Later] Implementer:
  - Implemented install-hook command
  - Added tests, 5/5 passing
  - Self-review: Found I missed --force flag, added it
  - Committed

[Dispatch spec compliance reviewer]
Spec reviewer: ✅ Spec compliant - all requirements met, nothing extra

[Get git SHAs, dispatch code quality reviewer]
Code reviewer: Strengths: Good test coverage, clean. Issues: None. Approved.

[Mark Task 1 complete]

Task 2: Recovery modes

[Get Task 2 text and context (already extracted)]
[Dispatch implementation subagent with full task text + context]

Implementer: [No questions, proceeds]
Implementer:
  - Added verify/repair modes
  - 8/8 tests passing
  - Self-review: All good
  - Committed

[Dispatch spec compliance reviewer]
Spec reviewer: ❌ Issues:
  - Missing: Progress reporting (spec says "report every 100 items")
  - Extra: Added --json flag (not requested)

[Implementer fixes issues]
Implementer: Removed --json flag, added progress reporting

[Spec reviewer reviews again]
Spec reviewer: ✅ Spec compliant now

[Dispatch code quality reviewer]
Code reviewer: Strengths: Solid. Issues (Important): Magic number (100)

[Implementer fixes]
Implementer: Extracted PROGRESS_INTERVAL constant

[Code reviewer reviews again]
Code reviewer: ✅ Approved

[Mark Task 2 complete]

...

[After all tasks]
[Dispatch final code-reviewer]
Final reviewer: All requirements met, ready to merge

Done!
```

## Advantages

**vs. Manual execution:**
- Subagents follow TDD naturally
- Fresh context per task (no confusion)
- Parallel-safe (subagents don't interfere)
- Subagent can ask questions (before AND during work)

**vs. Executing Plans:**
- Same session (no handoff)
- Continuous progress (no waiting)
- Review checkpoints automatic

**Efficiency gains:**
- No file reading overhead (controller provides full text)
- Controller curates exactly what context is needed
- Subagent gets complete information upfront
- Questions surfaced before work begins (not after)

**Quality gates:**
- Self-review catches issues before handoff
- Two-stage review: spec compliance, then code quality
- Review loops ensure fixes actually work
- Spec compliance prevents over/under-building
- Code quality ensures implementation is well-built

**Cost:**
- More subagent invocations (implementer + 2 reviewers per task)
- Controller does more prep work (extracting all tasks upfront)
- Review loops add iterations
- But catches issues early (cheaper than debugging later)

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Skip reviews (spec compliance OR code quality)
- Proceed with unfixed issues
- Dispatch multiple implementation subagents in parallel (conflicts)
- Make subagent read plan file (provide full text instead)
- Skip scene-setting context (subagent needs to understand where task fits)
- Ignore subagent questions (answer before letting them proceed)
- Accept "close enough" on spec compliance (spec reviewer found issues = not done)
- Skip review loops (reviewer found issues = implementer fixes = review again)
- Let implementer self-review replace actual review (both are needed)

**If subagent asks questions:**
- Answer clearly and completely
- Provide additional context if needed
- Don't rush them into implementation

**If reviewer finds issues:**
- Implementer (same subagent) fixes them
- Reviewer reviews again
- Repeat until approved
- Don't skip the re-review

**If subagent fails task:**
- Dispatch fix subagent with specific instructions
- Don't try to fix manually (context pollution)

## Integration

**Required workflow skills:**
- **writing-plans** - REQUIRED: Creates the plan that this skill executes
- **requesting-code-review** - REQUIRED: Review after each task (see Step 3)
- **finishing-a-development-branch** - REQUIRED: Complete development after all tasks (see Step 7)

**Subagents must use:**
- **test-driven-development** - Subagents follow TDD for each task

**Alternative workflow:**
- **executing-plans** - Use for parallel session instead of same-session execution
