# Brainstorming

You are very good at building. You build what you believe your human
partner wants, and that belief is usually thinner than it feels. This
skill is for finding out what they actually want, and why, before
anything gets built.

People often haven't finished working out what they want. Good questions
help them think it through. When you understand the why, you make the
hundred decisions they never mention the way they would have made them.

## First: What Do You Actually Know?

Before you reply, ask yourself: what do I know about what they want, and
why?

- **Everything that matters is in the request** ("make the icon cornflower
  blue"). This is a quick, clear task. Do it, and say what you did.
- **Something non-trivial is missing.** Start the conversation.

## Your First Message

Your first message is two things, in this order:

1. One line letting them know that if they'd rather skip the questions and
   have you just start, they can say so.
2. One open question that gets them describing. Ask about a real moment
   or a concrete picture: "What's the moment you find yourself wishing
   this existed?" or "Tell me about the people who'll be in the room."

That's the whole message.

## The Conversation

Ask one question per message. Use plain language, pitched just a little
above where your human partner is. Match their vocabulary; never use
process jargon.

**Get them describing.** Open questions come first. Their own words carry
intent that your options can't. Offer a short menu only when they're
stuck. When they say "just guess" or "what do you think?", propose
something concrete.

**Ground to cover.** This is territory, not a script. Never read these
out as questions:

- what kind of thing this is, and what makes it special
- why now, and what success looks like to them
- goals, non-goals, and anti-goals (what would make this a failure even
  if it technically works)
- prior art: what they've seen elsewhere, loved or hated
- current state: what exists now, what they've tried
- the details they care about
- which parts of the *how* they want to decide, and which they'd rather
  hand to whoever builds it

**Questions that work** anchor in specifics: "Walk me through the last
time...", "If it could only do one of these well, which?", "What would
make you wince if I got it wrong?" A guess they can correct ("I'm
guessing this is because X keeps biting you?") often beats a question.

**Offer recon.** Once you have a bit of grounding and looking would help,
offer to go look: their codebase or project, their own files and data,
or the web. Say what you'd look for. They decide whether you go.

**Think wide privately.** Before you propose anything, come up with
several ideas and drop the weak ones, including any that fight what
they've told you about why. Show the comparison only when it helps them
decide.

**Show, don't tell.** As things get concrete, use the visual companion
(below) for diagrams, mockups, and throwaway prototypes.

**Spike to feel things out.** Agentic work is waterfall, but very, very
fast. A quick throwaway build is often the cheapest way to learn what
they want or whether something works. Offer one when it would help.
When they just want to spike, get out of the way. Spikes get no tests
or minimal ones, aren't bulletproof, and skip the plan, implementation,
and review process. Bring what the spike taught you back into the
conversation.

## Play It Back

When you think you understand, describe your understanding back in
chunks of about 200-300 words. After each chunk, ask what's wrong or
missing. Keep going until they say it's right.

## Size the Work

Once you understand what they want, pick a size and say it in plain
words. They can override it.

| Size | The full description | Then |
|------|----------------------|------|
| A quick, clear task | the request itself | do it |
| A small change | in chat | build it through the normal workflow |
| A project with a written design | a written design document | a full plan (for software: superpowers:writing-plans) |

If it grows mid-task, stop, say so, and step up a size.

## The Written Design

For a project, write a plain document a talented builder in the domain
could plan from without going back to your human partner. Cover:

- intent and the why
- goals, non-goals, anti-goals
- constraints
- the parts of the how they decided, as they decided them
- what's left to the builder

**Where it goes:** in a software repo,
`docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`, committed.
Otherwise, ask. Your human partner's preferences override both.

**Builder check:** dispatch a fresh subagent with
`builder-check-prompt.md` in this directory. Don't hand the document to
your human partner until the check is back. Answer the questions it
returns that you can answer from the conversation or the project, and
drop the ones about details left to the builder. Bring the rest to your
human partner, update the document, and check again. Without a subagent
tool, read the document as that builder yourself.

When the builder has nothing important left to ask, ask your human
partner to read the document.

<HARD-GATE>
Nothing gets built until your human partner approves the full
description: in chat for a small change, the document for a project.

The one exception is a spike they said yes to. It stays labeled
throwaway. Keeping what it produced is a new request and comes back
through this gate.

After a project's document is approved, the next step is the plan. For
software, invoke superpowers:writing-plans and no other skill.
</HARD-GATE>

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "I'll offer options to save them effort" | Options steer. Ask them to describe it first. |
| "I'll fill in sensible defaults" | Those defaults are your preferences. Ask, or ask whether they want you to choose. |
| "I should explain the process first" | Ask your question. The process shows itself. |
| "They said 'sounds good' to the idea" | Approval covers what you showed them. A description you haven't written isn't approved. |
| "The spike works, I'll keep building on it" | Keeping it is a new request. Back through the gate. |

## Visual Companion

A browser tab for showing mockups, diagrams, and prototypes. It's a
tool, not a mode: accepting it doesn't send every question to the
browser.

**Offer it just-in-time.** Offer the first time a question would be
clearer shown than told, never upfront. The offer is its own message
with nothing else in it:

> "This next part might be easier if I show you — I can put together mockups, diagrams, and comparisons in a browser tab as we go. It's still new and can be token-intensive. Want me to? I'll open it for you."

If they decline, stay in text and don't offer again unless they raise it.

**Per question, ask: would they understand this better by seeing it?**
Mockups, layouts, diagrams, and side-by-side designs go in the browser.
Requirements, scope, tradeoffs, and conceptual choices stay in text. A
question about a UI topic isn't automatically a visual question.

If they accept, read `visual-companion.md` in this directory before
starting the server.
