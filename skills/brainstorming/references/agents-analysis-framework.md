# Agents Analysis Framework (Sowa) - Superpowers Reference

Source: [Agents Ontology](https://www.jfsowa.com/ontology/agents.htm)
Purpose: Improve requirement clarification and capability scoping. No workflow changes.

## Core Dimensions
- Purpose: What goal the agent is trying to achieve.
- Capability: What it can and cannot do.
- Perception: What inputs it can sense or access.
- Action: What outputs or actions it can take.
- Environment: What context constrains behavior (rules, tools, limits).

## Capability Ladder
- Reflex: immediate responses to signals.
- Representation: builds or uses internal models.
- Reasoning/Planning: evaluates options and sequences actions.
- Anticipation: predicts other agents or environment changes.

## Clarification Prompts
- Purpose: What outcome is the agent responsible for?
- Capability: What functions are in scope vs out of scope?
- Perception: What signals, data, or events can it observe?
- Action: What actions are allowed or required?
- Environment: What constraints or policies govern behavior?
- Level: Which capability ladder level is required (reflex, representation, reasoning, anticipation)?

## Output Mapping (for brainstorming notes)
- Intent summary: one sentence purpose.
- Capability boundaries: explicit in-scope/out-of-scope list.
- Inputs/outputs: named signals and actions.
- Environment constraints: policies, limits, dependencies.
- Required capability level: chosen ladder rung.

## Reference Logic
- Use when: The feature describes an agent, assistant, automation, or autonomous behavior.
- Adapt when: The system is not autonomous; treat the agent as the primary actor or workflow and map capability to feature scope.
