# Top-Level Analysis Framework (Sowa)

Use this framework to identify missing dimensions in your domain analysis.

## Classification Axes
Checks to classify any entity:
1. **Independent vs Relative vs Mediating**: Does it exist alone, in relation to others, or as a connection?
2. **Physical vs Abstract**: Is it matter/energy or information?
3. **Continuant vs Occurrent**: Does it persist in time (object) or happen over time (process)?

## Coverage Matrix
Ensure your analysis covers these central categories where applicable:
- **Entities**: Object, Schema, Structure.
- **Dynamic**: Process, Script, Situation.
- **Relational**: Participation, Description, Reason, Purpose, History.

## Usage
- **Classify**: Apply the axes to your key terms to disambiguate them.
- **Gap Check**: Use the matrix to see if you missed a "History" (record), a "Script" (plan), or a "Purpose".
