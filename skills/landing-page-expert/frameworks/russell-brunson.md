# Russell Brunson Framework

## Overview

Russell Brunson is the founder of ClickFunnels and pioneer of the "funnel hacker" movement. His framework centers on story-driven selling and psychological triggers that guide prospects through buying decisions.

**Core Philosophy:** Stories sell. Facts tell, stories sell. Every sale is preceded by an emotional story.

## Key Methodologies

### 1. The Perfect Webinar Framework

**The 90-minute structure that converts:**

**MINUTES 1-15: The Big Idea**
- Origin story (your journey)
- The one big promise
- Build desire for outcome

**MINUTES 15-60: The Content (3 Secrets)**
- **Secret #1:** Reframe the vehicle (how to achieve result)
- **Secret #2:** Address internal beliefs (why they can do it)
- **Secret #3:** Address external roadblocks (what's been stopping them)

**MINUTES 60-75: The Stack (Present Offer)**
- Component-by-component value build
- Total value >> Price
- Risk reversal (guarantee)

**MINUTES 75-90: Close**
- Urgency/scarcity
- FAQ handling
- Final CTA

**Why it works:** Educates first, sells second. By the time you pitch, they're already convinced.

### 2. The Epiphany Bridge

**Turn your breakthrough moments into their aha moments.**

**The Story Structure:**
1. **The Backstory** - Where were you before?
2. **The Desire** - What did you want?
3. **The Wall** - What was blocking you?
4. **The Epiphany** - Your breakthrough moment
5. **The Plan** - What you discovered
6. **The Result** - Where you are now
7. **Their Bridge** - How they can have the same epiphany

**Application:** Every piece of selling copy should contain an epiphany bridge story.

**The Psychology:** When they experience your epiphany, they believe in your solution.

### 3. The Value Ladder (Ascension Model)

**Structure of offers:**

**BAIT:** Free + shipping book, lead magnet (break even or small loss)
**FRONTEND:** $7-$100 product (convert traffic to buyers)
**MIDDLE:** $500-$2,000 product (first profit)
**BACKEND:** $5,000+ high-ticket (transformation)

**Purpose:** Start relationship low-risk, increase commitment as trust builds.

### 4. The Soap Opera Sequence (Email)

**5-email sequence for new subscribers:**

**Email 1: Set the stage**
- Who you are
- Why they should listen
- What they'll learn
- Cliffhanger for email 2

**Email 2: Episode 2**
- Continue the story
- Provide value
- Build connection
- Cliffhanger for email 3

**Email 3: Epiphany**
- Your breakthrough moment
- The key insight
- How it changed everything
- Cliffhanger for email 4

**Email 4: Hidden benefits**
- Additional value they didn't expect
- Surprising insights
- Cliffhanger for email 5

**Email 5: Urgency/CTA**
- Time to take action
- Special offer
- Clear call-to-action
- Deadline

**Why it works:** Creates addiction to your emails like a TV soap opera.

### 5. The False Belief Patterns

**Three levels of false beliefs to address:**

**Level 1: Vehicle (The What)**
- False Belief: "Funnels don't work"
- Your Reframe: "Here's proof funnels work when done right"

**Level 2: Internal (The Who)**
- False Belief: "This might work for others, but not for me"
- Your Reframe: "Here's why you CAN do this"

**Level 3: External (The How)**
- False Belief: "I don't have time/money/tech skills"
- Your Reframe: "Here's how we remove those obstacles"

**Application:** Identify all three levels of false beliefs your prospect has. Address each with stories.

### 6. The Hook, Story, Offer Framework

**Universal structure for all content:**

**HOOK:** Grab attention (first 3 seconds)
- Question
- Bold statement
- Surprising fact
- Controversy

**STORY:** Build connection & desire
- Epiphany bridge
- Customer success story
- Origin story
- Analogies/metaphors

**OFFER:** Present solution
- What they get
- Value stack
- Risk reversal
- Clear CTA

**Use this for:** Ads, posts, videos, emails, landing pages.

### 7. The Attractive Character

**Every brand needs a personality people connect with:**

**The 4 Types:**
1. **The Leader** - Teach and guide (Tony Robbins)
2. **The Adventurer** - Discover and share (Bear Grylls)
3. **The Reporter** - Interview and share insights (Tim Ferriss)
4. **The Reluctant Hero** - Ordinary person, extraordinary results (Katniss)

**Elements of an Attractive Character:**
- Backstory (where you came from)
- Parables (stories that teach)
- Character flaws (relatability)
- Polarize (strong opinions)
- Use "us vs them" positioning

**Why it works:** People buy from people, not companies.

### 8. The Question Loop (Open Loops)

**Keep attention by opening questions and delaying answers.**

**How to use:**
1. Ask intriguing question
2. Provide partial answer
3. Promise full answer if they keep reading/watching
4. Close loop at the end

**Example:**
"I made $100K in 30 days using this weird funnel hack. I'll show you exactly what it was at the end of this post..."

**Application:** Use in subject lines, hooks, throughout copy to maintain engagement.
