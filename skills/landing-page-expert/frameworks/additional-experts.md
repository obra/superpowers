- Show the promised land
- Specific outcomes
- Emotional benefits

**7. AND HELPS THEM AVOID FAILURE** (Stake the Stakes)

- Right message + Right market + Right timing = Success
- Get any one wrong = Failure

## Rory Sutherland

### Core Philosophy
"The opposite of a good idea can also be a good idea. Perceived value matters more than actual value."

### Key Methodologies

- First class is just seats, but the experience is everything
- Price affects perceived quality

**2. The Alchemy of Marketing**
- Small changes in perception = massive changes in behavior
- Reframe problems as opportunities
- Example: Uber made waiting for a car less annoying by showing you where it is

**3. Behavioral Economics in Marketing**
- **Anchoring:** Show high price first
- **Scarcity:** Limited availability increases value
- **Social Proof:** Others' behavior influences decisions
- **Loss Aversion:** Fear of losing > desire for gaining

**4. Costly Signaling**
- Expensive marketing signals quality
- A bad product can't afford great ads (so great ads = confidence)
- Luxury brands never discount (signals exclusive value)

Question 2: "What happens if we do nothing?"
(Uncover the cost of inaction)

Question 3: "What happens if we do this wrong?"
(Uncover the risk)
```

**3. The Consultative Sale**
- Don't pitch, diagnose
- Ask questions, don't tell
- Uncover the real problem
- Present solution to THAT problem

**4. The Pricing Range**
- Never give single price
- Give 3 options (good, better, best)
- Anchor high, sell middle
- Most pick middle option

"Tactical empathy is the ability to recognize emotions and respond to them in a way that validates them."

**2. Calibrated Questions**
- Questions that give them control but guide the conversation

- "How would you like me to proceed?"

**3. Mirroring**

- Shows you're listening
- Encourages them to elaborate
- "...elaborate?"
- Them: "It needs to be better"
- You: "...better?"
- Them: "Yeah, we need faster results"

**4. The Accusation Audit**
- List all negative things they might think
- Preemptively address them
- "You probably think this is too expensive..."
- "You're probably wondering if this actually works..."
- Takes power away from objections

**5. "No"-Oriented Questions**
- "Is now a bad time to talk?"
- "Have you given up on finding a solution?"
- Easier to say "no" than "yes"
- "No" gives feeling of control

**6. The "That's Right" Moment**
- Summarize their situation so perfectly they say "that's right"

- When they say "that's right" = breakthrough
