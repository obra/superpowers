## Preamble (run first)

```bash
_IS_SUPERPOWERS_RUNTIME_ROOT() {
  local candidate="$1"
  [ -n "$candidate" ] &&
  [ -x "$candidate/bin/superpowers-update-check" ] &&
  [ -x "$candidate/bin/superpowers-config" ] &&
  [ -f "$candidate/VERSION" ]
}
_REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)
_SUPERPOWERS_ROOT=""
_IS_SUPERPOWERS_RUNTIME_ROOT "$_REPO_ROOT" && _SUPERPOWERS_ROOT="$_REPO_ROOT"
[ -z "$_SUPERPOWERS_ROOT" ] && _IS_SUPERPOWERS_RUNTIME_ROOT "$HOME/.superpowers/install" && _SUPERPOWERS_ROOT="$HOME/.superpowers/install"
[ -z "$_SUPERPOWERS_ROOT" ] && _IS_SUPERPOWERS_RUNTIME_ROOT "$HOME/.codex/superpowers" && _SUPERPOWERS_ROOT="$HOME/.codex/superpowers"
[ -z "$_SUPERPOWERS_ROOT" ] && _IS_SUPERPOWERS_RUNTIME_ROOT "$HOME/.copilot/superpowers" && _SUPERPOWERS_ROOT="$HOME/.copilot/superpowers"
_UPD=""
[ -n "$_SUPERPOWERS_ROOT" ] && _UPD=$("$_SUPERPOWERS_ROOT/bin/superpowers-update-check" 2>/dev/null || true)
[ -n "$_UPD" ] && echo "$_UPD" || true
_SP_STATE_DIR="${SUPERPOWERS_STATE_DIR:-$HOME/.superpowers}"
mkdir -p "$_SP_STATE_DIR/sessions"
touch "$_SP_STATE_DIR/sessions/$PPID"
_SESSIONS=$(find "$_SP_STATE_DIR/sessions" -mmin -120 -type f 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
find "$_SP_STATE_DIR/sessions" -mmin +120 -type f -delete 2>/dev/null || true
_CONTRIB=""
[ -n "$_SUPERPOWERS_ROOT" ] && _CONTRIB=$("$_SUPERPOWERS_ROOT/bin/superpowers-config" get superpowers_contributor 2>/dev/null || true)
```

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: read the installed `superpowers-upgrade/SKILL.md` from the same superpowers root (check the current repo when it contains the Superpowers runtime, then `$HOME/.superpowers/install`, then `$HOME/.codex/superpowers`, then `$HOME/.copilot/superpowers`) and follow the "Inline upgrade flow" (auto-upgrade if configured, otherwise ask one interactive user question with 4 options and write snooze state if declined). If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: tell the user "Running superpowers v{to} (just updated!)" and continue.

## Interactive User Question Format

**ALWAYS follow this structure for every interactive user question:**
1. Context: project name, current branch, what we're working on (1-2 sentences)
2. The specific question or decision point
3. `RECOMMENDATION: Choose [X] because [one-line reason]`
4. Lettered options: `A) ... B) ... C) ...`

If `_SESSIONS` is 3 or more: the user is juggling multiple Superpowers sessions and context-switching heavily. **ELI16 mode** — they may not remember what this conversation is about. Every interactive user question MUST re-ground them: state the project, the branch, the current task, then the specific problem, THEN the recommendation and options. Be extra clear and self-contained — assume they haven't looked at this window in 20 minutes.

Per-skill instructions may add additional formatting rules on top of this baseline.

## Contributor Mode

If `_CONTRIB` is `true`: you are in **contributor mode**. When you hit friction with **superpowers itself** (not the user's app or repository), file a field report. Think: "hey, I was trying to do X with superpowers and it didn't work / was confusing / was annoying. Here's what happened."

**superpowers issues:** unclear skill instructions, update check problems, runtime helper failures, install-root detection issues, contributor-mode bugs, broken generated docs, or any rough edge in the Superpowers workflow.
**NOT superpowers issues:** the user's application bugs, repo-specific architecture problems, auth failures on the user's site, or third-party service outages unrelated to Superpowers tooling.

**To file:** write `~/.superpowers/contributor-logs/{slug}.md` with this structure:

```
# {Title}

Hey superpowers team — ran into this while using /{skill-name}:

**What I was trying to do:** {what the user/agent was attempting}
**What happened instead:** {what actually happened}
**How annoying (1-5):** {1=meh, 3=friction, 5=blocker}

## Steps to reproduce
1. {step}

## Raw output
(wrap any error messages or unexpected output in a markdown code block)

**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD} | **Version:** {superpowers version} | **Skill:** /{skill}
```

Then run:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.superpowers/contributor-logs
if command -v open >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  open ~/.superpowers/contributor-logs/{slug}.md
elif command -v xdg-open >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  xdg-open ~/.superpowers/contributor-logs/{slug}.md >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
fi
```

Slug: lowercase, hyphens, max 60 chars (for example `skill-trigger-missed`). Skip if the file already exists. Max 3 reports per session. File inline and continue — don't stop the workflow. Tell the user: "Filed superpowers field report: {title}"


# Finishing a Development Branch

## Overview

Guide completion of development work by presenting clear options and handling chosen workflow.

**Core principle:** Verify tests → Present options → Execute choice → Clean up.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."

## The Process

### Step 1: Verify Tests

**Before presenting options, verify tests pass:**

```bash
# Run project's test suite
npm test / cargo test / pytest / go test ./...
```

**If tests fail:**
```
Tests failing (<N> failures). Must fix before completing:

[Show failures]

Cannot proceed with merge/PR until tests pass.
```

Stop. Don't proceed to Step 2.

**If tests pass:** Continue to Step 2.

### Step 2: Determine Base Branch

```bash
# Try common base branches
git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD master 2>/dev/null
```

If the merge-base result is ambiguous, ask one interactive user question using the required format:
- Context: branch name and what is being completed
- Recommendation: the most likely base branch from local git history
- Options:
  - `A)` Use `main`
  - `B)` Use `master`
  - `C)` Keep current branch and let the user specify a different base branch

### Step 3: Present Options

Ask one interactive user question using the required format.

```
A) Merge back to <base-branch> locally
B) Push and create a Pull Request
C) Keep the branch as-is for follow-up later
D) Discard this work
```

Recommendation logic:
- Recommend `B)` when a normal PR flow is available and the user has not signaled a different preference
- Recommend `A)` when local integration is clearly preferred or PR tooling is unavailable
- Recommend `C)` when the user has indicated they want to continue later
- Never recommend `D)` by default

### Step 4: Execute Choice

#### Option A: Merge Locally

```bash
# Switch to base branch
git checkout <base-branch>

# Pull latest
git pull

# Merge feature branch
git merge <feature-branch>

# Verify tests on merged result
<test command>

# If tests pass
git branch -d <feature-branch>
```

Then: Cleanup worktree (Step 5)

#### Option B: Push and Create PR

```bash
# Push branch
git push -u origin <feature-branch>

# Create PR
gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<2-3 bullets of what changed>

## Test Plan
- [ ] <verification steps>
EOF
)"
```

Then: Keep the branch and worktree for follow-up until the PR is merged.

#### Option C: Keep As-Is

Report: "Keeping branch <name>. Worktree preserved at <path>."

**Don't cleanup worktree.**

#### Option D: Discard

**Confirm first:**
```
This will permanently delete:
- Branch <name>
- All commits: <commit-list>
- Worktree at <path>

Type 'discard' to confirm.
```

Wait for exact confirmation.

If confirmed:
```bash
git checkout <base-branch>
git branch -D <feature-branch>
```

Then: Cleanup worktree (Step 5)

### Step 5: Cleanup Worktree

**For Options A and D:**

Check if in worktree:
```bash
git worktree list | grep $(git branch --show-current)
```

If yes:
```bash
git worktree remove <worktree-path>
```

**For Option C:** Keep worktree.

## Quick Reference

| Option | Merge | Push | Keep Worktree | Cleanup Branch |
|--------|-------|------|---------------|----------------|
| A. Merge locally | ✓ | - | - | ✓ |
| B. Create PR | - | ✓ | ✓ | - |
| C. Keep as-is | - | - | ✓ | - |
| D. Discard | - | - | - | ✓ (force) |

## Common Mistakes

**Skipping test verification**
- **Problem:** Merge broken code, create failing PR
- **Fix:** Always verify tests before offering options

**Open-ended questions**
- **Problem:** "What should I do next?" → ambiguous
- **Fix:** Present exactly 4 structured options

**Automatic worktree cleanup**
- **Problem:** Remove worktree when might need it (Option B, C)
- **Fix:** Only cleanup for Options A and D

**No confirmation for discard**
- **Problem:** Accidentally delete work
- **Fix:** Require typed "discard" confirmation

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Proceed with failing tests
- Merge without verifying tests on result
- Delete work without confirmation
- Force-push without explicit request

**Always:**
- Verify tests before offering options
- Present exactly 4 options
- Get typed confirmation for Option D
- Clean up worktree for Options A & D only

## Integration

**Called by:**
- **subagent-driven-development** - After the final review passes and all tasks are complete
- **executing-plans** - After the final review is resolved and all tasks are complete

**Pairs with:**
- **using-git-worktrees** - Cleans up worktree created by that skill
