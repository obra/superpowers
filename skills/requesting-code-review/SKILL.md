## Preamble (run first)

```bash
_IS_SUPERPOWERS_RUNTIME_ROOT() {
  local candidate="$1"
  [ -n "$candidate" ] &&
  [ -x "$candidate/bin/superpowers-update-check" ] &&
  [ -x "$candidate/bin/superpowers-config" ] &&
  [ -f "$candidate/VERSION" ]
}
_REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)
_SUPERPOWERS_ROOT=""
_IS_SUPERPOWERS_RUNTIME_ROOT "$_REPO_ROOT" && _SUPERPOWERS_ROOT="$_REPO_ROOT"
[ -z "$_SUPERPOWERS_ROOT" ] && _IS_SUPERPOWERS_RUNTIME_ROOT "$HOME/.superpowers/install" && _SUPERPOWERS_ROOT="$HOME/.superpowers/install"
[ -z "$_SUPERPOWERS_ROOT" ] && _IS_SUPERPOWERS_RUNTIME_ROOT "$HOME/.codex/superpowers" && _SUPERPOWERS_ROOT="$HOME/.codex/superpowers"
[ -z "$_SUPERPOWERS_ROOT" ] && _IS_SUPERPOWERS_RUNTIME_ROOT "$HOME/.copilot/superpowers" && _SUPERPOWERS_ROOT="$HOME/.copilot/superpowers"
_UPD=""
[ -n "$_SUPERPOWERS_ROOT" ] && _UPD=$("$_SUPERPOWERS_ROOT/bin/superpowers-update-check" 2>/dev/null || true)
[ -n "$_UPD" ] && echo "$_UPD" || true
_SP_STATE_DIR="${SUPERPOWERS_STATE_DIR:-$HOME/.superpowers}"
mkdir -p "$_SP_STATE_DIR/sessions"
touch "$_SP_STATE_DIR/sessions/$PPID"
_SESSIONS=$(find "$_SP_STATE_DIR/sessions" -mmin -120 -type f 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
find "$_SP_STATE_DIR/sessions" -mmin +120 -type f -delete 2>/dev/null || true
_CONTRIB=""
[ -n "$_SUPERPOWERS_ROOT" ] && _CONTRIB=$("$_SUPERPOWERS_ROOT/bin/superpowers-config" get superpowers_contributor 2>/dev/null || true)
```

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: read the installed `superpowers-upgrade/SKILL.md` from the same superpowers root (check the current repo when it contains the Superpowers runtime, then `$HOME/.superpowers/install`, then `$HOME/.codex/superpowers`, then `$HOME/.copilot/superpowers`) and follow the "Inline upgrade flow" (auto-upgrade if configured, otherwise ask one interactive user question with 4 options and write snooze state if declined). If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: tell the user "Running superpowers v{to} (just updated!)" and continue.

## Interactive User Question Format

**ALWAYS follow this structure for every interactive user question:**
1. Context: project name, current branch, what we're working on (1-2 sentences)
2. The specific question or decision point
3. `RECOMMENDATION: Choose [X] because [one-line reason]`
4. Lettered options: `A) ... B) ... C) ...`

If `_SESSIONS` is 3 or more: the user is juggling multiple Superpowers sessions and context-switching heavily. **ELI16 mode** — they may not remember what this conversation is about. Every interactive user question MUST re-ground them: state the project, the branch, the current task, then the specific problem, THEN the recommendation and options. Be extra clear and self-contained — assume they haven't looked at this window in 20 minutes.

Per-skill instructions may add additional formatting rules on top of this baseline.

## Contributor Mode

If `_CONTRIB` is `true`: you are in **contributor mode**. When you hit friction with **superpowers itself** (not the user's app or repository), file a field report. Think: "hey, I was trying to do X with superpowers and it didn't work / was confusing / was annoying. Here's what happened."

**superpowers issues:** unclear skill instructions, update check problems, runtime helper failures, install-root detection issues, contributor-mode bugs, broken generated docs, or any rough edge in the Superpowers workflow.
**NOT superpowers issues:** the user's application bugs, repo-specific architecture problems, auth failures on the user's site, or third-party service outages unrelated to Superpowers tooling.

**To file:** write `~/.superpowers/contributor-logs/{slug}.md` with this structure:

```
# {Title}

Hey superpowers team — ran into this while using /{skill-name}:

**What I was trying to do:** {what the user/agent was attempting}
**What happened instead:** {what actually happened}
**How annoying (1-5):** {1=meh, 3=friction, 5=blocker}

## Steps to reproduce
1. {step}

## Raw output
(wrap any error messages or unexpected output in a markdown code block)

**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD} | **Version:** {superpowers version} | **Skill:** /{skill}
```

Then run:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.superpowers/contributor-logs
if command -v open >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  open ~/.superpowers/contributor-logs/{slug}.md
elif command -v xdg-open >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  xdg-open ~/.superpowers/contributor-logs/{slug}.md >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
fi
```

Slug: lowercase, hyphens, max 60 chars (for example `skill-trigger-missed`). Skip if the file already exists. Max 3 reports per session. File inline and continue — don't stop the workflow. Tell the user: "Filed superpowers field report: {title}"


# Requesting Code Review

Dispatch the `code-reviewer` sub-agent or custom agent to catch issues before they cascade. The reviewer gets precisely crafted context for evaluation — never your session's history. This keeps the reviewer focused on the work product, not your thought process, and preserves your own context for continued work.

In Codex, Superpowers installs the `code-reviewer` custom agent alongside the shared skills checkout. In GitHub Copilot local installs, Superpowers installs the same reviewer through the platform's custom-agent path.

**Core principle:** Review early, review often.

## When to Request Review

**Mandatory:**
- After each task in subagent-driven development
- After completing major feature
- Before merge to the target base branch

**Optional but valuable:**
- When stuck (fresh perspective)
- Before refactoring (baseline check)
- After fixing complex bug

## How to Request

**1. Detect the base branch and review range:**
```bash
BASE_BRANCH=$(gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName 2>/dev/null || gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name 2>/dev/null || echo main)
git fetch origin "$BASE_BRANCH" --quiet 2>/dev/null || true
BASE_SHA=$(git merge-base HEAD "origin/$BASE_BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD "$BASE_BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || git rev-parse HEAD~1)
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

The reviewer should use the shared review checklist from `review/checklist.md` in the repo when available, otherwise fall back to the installed Superpowers copy.

**2. Dispatch the code-reviewer agent:**

Use the `code-reviewer` agent and fill the template at `code-reviewer.md`

**Placeholders:**
- `{WHAT_WAS_IMPLEMENTED}` - What you just built
- `{PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS}` - What it should do
- `{BASE_BRANCH}` - The detected base branch name
- `{BASE_SHA}` - Starting commit
- `{HEAD_SHA}` - Ending commit
- `{DESCRIPTION}` - Brief summary

**3. Act on feedback:**
- Fix Critical issues immediately
- Fix Important issues before proceeding
- Note Minor issues for later
- Capture documentation or TODO follow-ups instead of silently dropping them
- Push back if reviewer is wrong (with reasoning)

## Example

```
[Just completed Task 2: Add verification function]

You: Let me request code review before proceeding.

BASE_BRANCH=$(gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName 2>/dev/null || gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name 2>/dev/null || echo main)
BASE_SHA=$(git merge-base HEAD "origin/$BASE_BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD "$BASE_BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || git log --oneline | grep "Task 1" | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

[Dispatch code-reviewer agent]
  WHAT_WAS_IMPLEMENTED: Verification and repair functions for conversation index
  PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS: Task 2 from docs/superpowers/plans/deployment-plan.md
  BASE_BRANCH: main
  BASE_SHA: a7981ec
  HEAD_SHA: 3df7661
  DESCRIPTION: Added verifyIndex() and repairIndex() with 4 issue types

[Subagent returns]:
  Strengths: Clean architecture, real tests, checklist pass covered enum consumers
  Issues:
    Important: Missing progress indicators
    Minor: Magic number (100) for reporting interval
  Assessment: Ready to proceed

You: [Fix progress indicators]
[Continue to Task 3]
```

## Integration with Workflows

**Subagent-Driven Development:**
- Review after EACH task
- Catch issues before they compound
- Fix before moving to next task

**Executing Plans:**
- Review after execution is complete and verified
- Use an earlier review only if you intentionally want an extra checkpoint

**Ad-Hoc Development:**
- Review before merge
- Review when stuck

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Skip review because "it's simple"
- Ignore Critical issues
- Proceed with unfixed Important issues
- Argue with valid technical feedback

**If reviewer wrong:**
- Push back with technical reasoning
- Show code/tests that prove it works
- Request clarification
