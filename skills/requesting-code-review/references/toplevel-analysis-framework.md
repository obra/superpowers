# Top-Level Category Analysis Framework (Sowa) - Superpowers Reference

Source: [Toplevel Ontology](https://www.jfsowa.com/ontology/toplevel.htm)
Purpose: Improve requirement classification and coverage checks. No workflow changes.

## Classification Axes
- Independent vs Relative vs Mediating
- Physical vs Abstract
- Continuant vs Occurrent

## Coverage Matrix (12 central categories)
- Object / Process / Schema / Script
- Juncture / Participation / Description / History
- Structure / Situation / Reason / Purpose

## Clarification Prompts
- Is this primarily an entity, a relationship, or a mediator?
- Is it physical (located) or abstract (information)?
- Does it persist (continuant) or happen over time (occurrent)?
- Do we need a script (plan/recipe/program) distinct from the process?
- Do we need a description or history distinct from purpose or reason?

## Output Mapping (for planning/review)
- Domain classification: axis selections.
- Category coverage: which matrix cells are in scope.
- Missing elements: list gaps (e.g., purpose not defined, no history).

## Reference Logic
- Use when: The scope mixes objects, processes, descriptions, or intentions.
- Adapt when: The domain is simple; use only the axis classification and skip the full matrix.
