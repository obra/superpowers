# Writing Plans

## Overview

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context for our codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

Assume they are a skilled developer, but know almost nothing about our toolset or problem domain. Assume they don't know good test design very well.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan."

**Context:** If working in an isolated worktree, it should have been created via the `superpowers-prepared:using-git-worktrees` skill at execution time.

## Output Path

Save to `docs/superpowers-prepared/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`.
- User preferences for plan location override this default.

## Plan Header

```markdown
# <Feature Name> Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers-prepared:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers-prepared:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** <single sentence>
**Architecture:** <2-4 sentences>
**Tech Stack:** <languages/libraries/tools>
**Assumptions:** <list the key assumptions this plan rests on. For each, state what it excludes: "Assumes X — will NOT work if Y."> *(skip only if the plan contains zero conditional logic)*

```

## Scope Check

If the spec covers multiple independent subsystems, it should have been broken into sub-project specs during brainstorming. If it wasn't, suggest breaking this into separate plans — one per subsystem. Each plan should produce working, testable software on its own.

## File Structure

Before defining tasks, map out which files will be created or modified and what each one is responsible for. This is where decomposition decisions get locked in.

- Design units with clear boundaries and well-defined interfaces. Each file should have one clear responsibility.
- Prefer smaller, focused files over large ones that do too much — you reason best about code you can hold in context at once, and your edits are more reliable when files are focused.
- Files that change together should live together. Split by responsibility, not by technical layer.
- In existing codebases, follow established patterns. If the codebase uses large files, don't unilaterally restructure — but if a file you're modifying has grown unwieldy, including a split in the plan is reasonable.

This structure informs the task decomposition. Each task should produce self-contained changes that make sense independently.

## Task Rules

- Keep tasks independent when possible.
- Keep each step to one action (roughly 2-5 minutes).
- Use exact file paths.
- Include exact verification commands and expected outcomes.
- Use TDD ordering when code behavior changes.
- For ambiguous features, ask clarifying questions before finalizing the plan rather than guessing.

## Task Template

````markdown
### Task N: <Name>

**Files:**
- Create: `<path>`
- Modify: `<path>`
- Test: `<path>`

**Security flag:** `none` *(set to `security` if this task handles auth, credentials, input validation, permissions, crypto, or data access boundaries — triggers pre-implementation security review before the implementer is dispatched)*

**Does NOT cover:** *(required when this task adds a condition, gate, trigger, or any "when X do Y" logic — state the scenarios the condition excludes. If an excluded scenario should be covered, revise this task before implementing.)*

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing test**

```<lang>
<actual test code>
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `<command>`
Expected: FAIL with "<expected failure reason>"

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement minimal change**

```<lang>
<actual implementation code>
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `<command>`
Expected: PASS

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "<message>"
```
````

## No Placeholders

Every step must contain the actual content an engineer needs. These are **plan failures** — never write them:
- "TBD", "TODO", "implement later", "fill in details"
- "Add appropriate error handling" / "add validation" / "handle edge cases"
- "Write tests for the above" (without actual test code)
- "Similar to Task N" (repeat the code — the engineer may be reading tasks out of order)
- Steps that describe what to do without showing how (code blocks required for code steps)
- References to types, functions, or methods not defined in any task

## Quality Bar

- No vague steps like "update logic".
- No hidden dependencies between distant tasks.
- Call out migrations, feature flags, and rollback checks when relevant.
- Prefer small vertical slices over large horizontal phases.

## Self-Review

After writing the complete plan, look at the spec with fresh eyes and check the plan against it. This is a checklist you run yourself — not a subagent dispatch.

**1. Spec coverage:** Skim each section/requirement in the spec. Can you point to a task that implements it? List any gaps.

**2. Placeholder scan:** Search your plan for red flags — any of the patterns from the "No Placeholders" section above. Fix them.

**3. Type consistency:** Do the types, method signatures, and property names you used in later tasks match what you defined in earlier tasks? A function called `clearLayers()` in Task 3 but `clearFullLayers()` in Task 7 is a bug.

**4. Scope-reduction scan:** Search the plan for: "v1", "basic", "simple", "for now", "placeholder", "initial version", "minimal". For each hit, verify it was explicitly sanctioned by the user — not a quiet scope downgrade from what was requested. Fix any that weren't.

If you find issues, fix them inline. No need to re-review — just fix and move on. If you find a spec requirement with no task, add the task.

## Execution Handoff

After saving the plan and completing self-review, auto-select the execution approach using the logic below, then output the ready message and **stop**. Do not invoke any execution skill until the user replies.

### Selection Logic (evaluate in order)

1. Current context window ≥ 60% full → **Subagent-Driven** (offload context pressure)
2. Task count ≥ 5 → **Subagent-Driven** (fresh context per task)
3. Tasks have heavy inter-task state sharing (each task depends on runtime state from the previous) → **Inline**
4. Default → **Subagent-Driven**

### Ready Message

```
Plan saved to `docs/superpowers-prepared/plans/<filename>.md`. Ready to execute with **[Subagent-Driven / Inline Execution]** (<N> tasks[, <one-word reason>]). Reply to start, or say "inline" / "subagent" to switch.
```

**Stop here.** Do not invoke any execution skill until the user replies.

### On User Reply

**If Subagent-Driven:**
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers-prepared:subagent-driven-development
- Fresh subagent per task + two-stage review

**If Inline Execution:**
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers-prepared:executing-plans
- Continuous execution with checkpoints for review
