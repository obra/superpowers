  Use when building with any AI SDK or API — Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google.
  Fetches current documentation in real time before answering, so stale
  training data doesn't cause bugs. Trigger on: model selection, tool use,
  function calling, streaming, prompt caching, batch processing, SDK setup,
  or any AI API integration, planning, debugging, or code review.

## Why this skill exists

AI platforms change constantly: model IDs get renamed, parameters get
deprecated, new features launch behind flags, entire APIs get replaced. Your
training data has a cutoff — this skill fetches live docs before you advise on
any AI SDK integration, catching the gap between what you remember and what's
actually current.

A 30-second doc check prevents hours of wasted implementation effort.

## Step 1: Detect which provider is in scope

Check imports, environment variables, model names, or the user's stated intent:

| Signal | Provider |
|--------|----------|
| `import anthropic`, `from anthropic import`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, model names like `claude-*`, `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku` | **Anthropic** |
| `from openai import`, `import openai`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, model names like `gpt-*`, `o1`, `o3`, `chatgpt-*` | **OpenAI** |
| `import google.generativeai`, `from google import genai`, `import vertexai`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, model names like `gemini-*` | **Google** |

If multiple providers are in scope (e.g. a multi-provider app), fetch docs for each.
If unclear, ask the user which SDK they're targeting before fetching.

---

## Step 2: Fetch the relevant live docs

Use your web fetching tool (WebFetch, web_search, browse, or equivalent).

**Always fetch the models page first** — model IDs are the most common source
of outdated guidance, and the user will copy-paste whatever you put in example
code. Stale IDs produce confusing "model not found" errors.

**If a URL fails or returns a redirect/404**, don't stop — search for it instead.
Restrict the search to the provider's official docs domain to avoid landing on
blog posts or unofficial mirrors:
- Anthropic: `site:platform.claude.com/docs`
- OpenAI: `site:platform.openai.com/docs`
- Google: `site:ai.google.dev`

Example queries: `site:platform.claude.com/docs adaptive thinking` or
`site:platform.openai.com/docs responses API`. Doc URLs move; the information
is always findable on the canonical domain.

Fetch only what's relevant to the task. Three parallel fetches is ideal; don't
flood context with docs the user doesn't need.

## Step 3: Surface a brief summary

Present only what's relevant and potentially surprising given your training
data. Aim for 5–10 bullet points, not a wall of text:

**Current recommended models:** [list the relevant current model IDs]

**Key API details for [features in scope]:** [params, headers, syntax that matters]

**Watch out for:** [deprecations, gotchas, recently changed behavior — omit if nothing notable]

If the docs confirm what you'd expect:
*"Docs confirm current expected behavior. Recommended model: `claude-opus-4-6`."*

---

## Step 4: Proceed with the original task

Carry the grounded context forward into all code, tests, plans, and reviews.
The correct model IDs, parameter names, and feature knowledge should flow
through naturally — don't repeat the summary, just use it.

**If invoked before a superpowers skill:** proceed to invoke that skill next.
The live context is now loaded — carry it forward.

## Common things to verify

Things that change often and are most likely to be wrong in training data:

### Anthropic
- **`budget_tokens`** — deprecated on Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6; use `thinking: {type: "adaptive"}`
- **`output_format`** — deprecated; use `output_config: {format: {...}}`
- **Prefill on Opus 4.6** — not supported; use structured outputs or system prompt
- **Model ID suffixes** — never construct date-suffixed IDs from memory; always verify exact alias from models page
- **Files API beta header** — still requires `anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14`
- **Compaction beta header** — requires `anthropic-beta: compact-2026-01-12`, Opus 4.6 only
- **Docs base URL** — `docs.anthropic.com` now redirects to `platform.claude.com/docs/en/`

### OpenAI
- **Responses API vs Chat Completions** — Responses API is newer and preferred for agentic use cases; they are not interchangeable
- **Model ID naming** — `o1`, `o3`, `o3-mini`, `gpt-4o` variants change frequently; always verify from models page
- **SDK v1 breaking changes** — the openai Python SDK v1 was a complete rewrite from v0; code written for v0 will break
- **Structured outputs vs JSON mode** — structured outputs are newer and more reliable; JSON mode is an older pattern

### Google
- **Gemini API vs Vertex AI** — two different SDKs and endpoint structures; clarify which the user is targeting before advising
- **Model names** — `gemini-2.0-flash`, `gemini-1.5-pro`, etc. change frequently; always verify

## Superpowers integration

Live doc lookup is most valuable before any planning, implementation, testing,
debugging, or review of AI SDK work — catching stale assumptions before they
get baked into a plan or test suite.

| Superpowers skill | Why live docs matter |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| **brainstorming** | Architecture decisions bake in model choices and API patterns |
| **writing-plans** | Plans contain model IDs, API call patterns, parameter names |
| **test-driven-development** | Tests depend on exact response formats, param names, stop reasons |
| **systematic-debugging** | Debugging API errors needs current known behavior, not assumptions |
| **executing-plans** | Plans may not have had live doc grounding at write time |
| **subagent-driven-development** | Subagents write code independently; they need accurate API context upfront |
| **dispatching-parallel-agents** | Same — agents need correct params from the start |
| **requesting-code-review** | Reviewers need current docs to spot stale patterns |
| **verification-before-completion** | Verifying AI API code requires knowing current expected behavior |
