# Superpowers v2.0.0 Release Notes

## Overview

Superpowers v2.0 makes skills more accessible, maintainable, and community-driven through a major architectural shift.

The headline change is **skills repository separation**: all skills, scripts, and documentation have moved from the plugin into a dedicated repository ([joegoldin/superpowers-skills](https://github.com/joegoldin/superpowers-skills)). This transforms superpowers from a monolithic plugin into a lightweight shim that manages a local clone of the skills repository. Skills auto-update on session start. Users fork and contribute improvements via standard git workflows. The skills library versions independently from the plugin.

Beyond infrastructure, this release adds nine new skills focused on problem-solving, research, and architecture. We rewrote the core **using-skills** documentation with imperative tone and clearer structure, making it easier for Claude to understand when and how to use skills. **find-skills** now outputs paths you can paste directly into the Read tool, eliminating friction in the skills discovery workflow.

Users experience seamless operation: the plugin handles cloning, forking, and updating automatically. Contributors find the new architecture makes improving and sharing skills trivial. This release lays the foundation for skills to evolve rapidly as a community resource.

## Breaking Changes

### Skills Repository Separation

**The biggest change:** Skills no longer live in the plugin. They've been moved to a separate repository at [joegoldin/superpowers-skills](https://github.com/joegoldin/superpowers-skills).

**What this means for you:**

- **First install:** Plugin automatically clones skills to `~/.config/superpowers/skills/`
- **Forking:** During setup, you'll be offered the option to fork the skills repo (if `gh` is installed)
- **Updates:** Skills auto-update on session start (fast-forward when possible)
- **Contributing:** Work on branches, commit locally, submit PRs to upstream
- **No more shadowing:** Old two-tier system (personal/core) replaced with single-repo branch workflow

**Migration:**

If you have an existing installation:
1. Your old `~/.config/superpowers/.git` will be backed up to `~/.config/superpowers/.git.bak`
2. Old skills will be backed up to `~/.config/superpowers/skills.bak`
3. Fresh clone of joegoldin/superpowers-skills will be created at `~/.config/superpowers/skills/`

### Removed Features

- **Personal superpowers overlay system** - Replaced with git branch workflow
- **setup-personal-superpowers hook** - Replaced by initialize-skills.sh
