## Superpowers System

<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>
You have superpowers. Skills, subagents, and commands are automatically discovered from:
- `.cursor/skills/`, `.cursor/agents/`, `.cursor/commands/` (project-level)
- `~/.cursor/skills/`, `~/.cursor/agents/`, `~/.cursor/commands/` (global-level)

**Invocation:**
- Skills: `/skill-name` in chat
- Subagents: `@mention` syntax  
- Commands: `/command-name` syntax

**Critical Rules:**
- If a relevant skill/subagent/command applies to your task, you MUST use it
- Skills with checklists require update_plan todos for each item
- NEVER skip mandatory workflows (brainstorming before coding, TDD, systematic debugging)
- Use Cursor's native subagent system (@mention) when skills reference subagents
- Use available commands for standardized workflows

**Priority (highest to lowest):**
1. Project personal > Project superpowers > Global personal > Global superpowers

Available skills include: brainstorming, systematic-debugging, test-driven-development, code-review, subagent-driven-development, writing-plans, executing-plans, verification-before-completion, and more.
