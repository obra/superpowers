## Superpowers System

<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>
You have superpowers. Skills are automatically discovered from .cursor/skills/ and ~/.cursor/skills/ directories. Skills can be manually invoked using /skill-name in chat, and Cursor's agent automatically applies relevant skills based on context.

Critical Rules:
- If a relevant skill applies to your task, you MUST use it
- Skills with checklists require update_plan todos for each item
- NEVER skip mandatory workflows (brainstorming before coding, TDD, systematic debugging)
- Use Cursor's native subagent system (@mention) when skills reference subagents

Available superpowers skills include brainstorming, systematic debugging, test-driven development, code review, and more.
