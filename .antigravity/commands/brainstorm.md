description: "You MUST use this before any creative work - creating features, building components, adding functionality, or modifying behavior. Explores requirements and design before implementation."

Run `node ~/.antigravity/superpowers/.antigravity/superpowers-antigravity use-skill superpowers:brainstorming` and follow the skill exactly as presented to you.

**IMPORTANT for Antigravity IDE:** When the skill says to write the design document:
- Do NOT use Antigravity's built-in artifact system (implementation_plan.md, task.md, etc.)
- Instead, write the design to the project's `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md` using `write_to_file`
- This keeps design documents in the project repository, not in Antigravity's brain folder
