description: Create detailed implementation plan with bite-sized tasks
---

Run `node ~/.antigravity/superpowers/.antigravity/superpowers-antigravity use-skill superpowers:writing-plans` and follow the skill exactly as presented to you.

**IMPORTANT for Antigravity IDE:** When the skill says to save plans:
- Do NOT use Antigravity's built-in artifact system (implementation_plan.md, task.md, etc.)
- Instead, write plans to the project's `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md` using `write_to_file`
- This keeps plans in the project repository, not in Antigravity's brain folder
