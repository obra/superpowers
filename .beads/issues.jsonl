{"id":"hyperpowers-1","title":"Incorporate the Ralph Wiggum technique into Hyperpowers","description":"Investigate and incorporate the Ralph Wiggum technique - an agentic coding pattern that uses a simple loop to continuously run AI agents for autonomous code generation.\n\n## Background\n\nThe Ralph Wiggum Technique was created by Geoff Huntley. The core implementation is:\n\n```bash\nwhile :; do cat PROMPT.md | npx --yes @sourcegraph/amp ; done\n```\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n- **Context Engineering**: Carving work into independent context windows rather than running indefinitely to avoid \"overbaking\"\n- **Declarative Specifications**: Using detailed prompt files that describe desired outcomes\n- **Iterative Refinement**: AI agent repeatedly processes prompts, refining across iterations\n\n## Resources\n\n- Blog post: https://www.humanlayer.dev/blog/brief-history-of-ralph\n- Saved HTML: docs/research/ralph-wiggum-technique.html\n\n## Potential Applications for Hyperpowers\n\n- Code refactoring with standardized guidelines\n- Specification generation from requirements\n- New project scaffolding\n- Incremental improvements to existing codebases","status":"open","priority":"medium","created_at":"2026-01-12T00:00:00Z","updated_at":"2026-01-12T00:00:00Z","labels":["research","enhancement"]}
